<stage>FADE IN</stage>

We begin with a poster of Krusty the Clown, Springfield's favorite clown. The real KRUSTY rides through the poster on his small car. He steps out to the applause of many children.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Hey, kids! Who do you love?

<stage>KIDS</stage>Krusty!!

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>How much do you love me?

The image transforms into a TV set which <fam>Bart</fam> and <fam>Lisa</fam> and Maggie are watching. They speak in sync with the children.

KIDS + BART +<stage> LISA</stage>With all our hearts!

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>What would you do if I went off the air?

KIDS + BART +<stage> LISA</stage>We'd k*ll ourselves!

Krusty the Clown laughs and then turns to face his assistant, Sideshow Bob.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>What's that, Sideshow Bob? This is Brittany and today's her birthday? Well, happy birthday, Brittany! How do you wanna celebrate? Do you want me to sing you a birthday song?

Sideshow Bob hoots his horn.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Or do you want me to sh**t Sideshow Bob out of a cannon?

<stage>KIDS</stage>The cannon! The cannon!

BART +<stage> LISA</stage>The cannon! The cannon!

<stage>GIRL</stage>The cannon.

Krusty turns and speaks silently to Sideshow Bob.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Sorry, Sideshow Bob....but it's her special birthday wish!

The kids cheer as Krusty laughs.

BART (laughing): You're doomed, Sideshow Bob.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>I know we haven't had much luck sh**ting you out of this cannon, but maybe that's because we haven't used enough g*n!

He waves a barrel in front of the children and then pours it into the cannon as the children cheer.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Brittany, do the honors.

He hands her a flaming stick and she lights the cannon. Krusty holds his ears as it sh**t and flies back.

Sideshow Bob falls out of several seconds later, his hair wired and straight, and close to completely undressed.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Don't blame me.

KRUSTY +<stage> KIDS</stage>I didn't do it.

They all laugh.

<stage>BART</stage>Comedy, thy name is Krusty.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Hey, kids, its time for Itchy and Scratchy.

<stage>ITCHY AND SCRATCHY CHORUS</stage>They fight, they bite, they bite and fight and bite. Fight, fight, fight, bite, bite, bite. The Itchy and Scratchy Show!

The name of the segment is called "Burning Love".

Scratchy the Cat lies peacefully in a hammock. Itchy lights an arrow on f*re and sh**t it into Scratchy's behind. He runs around and screams as <fam>Bart</fam> and <fam>Lisa</fam> laugh. <fam>Marge</fam> walks in.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Oh, my! All this senseless v*olence. I don't understand its appeal.

<stage>BART</stage>We don't expect you to, Mom.

<stage>LISA</stage>If cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

<fam>Homer</fam> eating donuts at work (not in his office). A telephone behind him rings and he picks it up.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Yello.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Hello, Homie. I was hoping you could pick up a half-gallon of premium ice cream on your way home from work.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Ooh, premium --- wait a minute. Why?

<stage>MARGE</stage>Patty and Selma are coming over to show us slides from their trip to the Yucatan.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Doh!

At the Simpsons, the doorbell rings.

PATTY +<stage> SELMA</stage>Anybody home?

<stage>MARGE</stage>Ooh, I've go to go, <fam>Homer</fam>. My sisters are here.

She walks over and opens the door. Patty and Selma immediately walk in with their projectors without a proper greeting.<stage>MARGE</stage>Ooh..eight carousels! We're in for a real treat.

<fam>Bart</fam> and <fam>Lisa</fam> both groan.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

1986.

An old clip is shown of the incident.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Wasn't that a great Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, kids? Well, we've got another one coming right up. But first, I've got a hankering for some pork products.

Sideshow Bob slides over a grill with various meats on it.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Mmm. Look. Plump succulent sausage, honey-smoked bacon and glistening, sizzling ---

He starts grasping his chest as the heart att*ck comes on. The kids laugh and cheer in joy. He falls to the floor.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>I'm dying. I'm dying.

35 of the Man in the Iron Mask: "The Death of a Titan."

A piano plays softly in the background.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Well, kids, that's our show for today. And now, in the words of Mr. Cole Porter... (singing)Everytime we say good-bye

I die a little

Everytime we say good-bye

I wonder why a little

Every time we say goodbye...

Goodbye.

<stage>TRANSITION TO</stage>

Sideshow Bob signing autographs as he walks down the hall.

<stage>MANAGER</stage>Great show, Sideshow. Switchboards were jammed. The kids loved it.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Thanks, Ed. I'm glad we've finally dispelled the myth that I'm too uptown for my tots. And yet, I can't help thinking about poor Krusty.

Sideshow Bob weeps as he closes the door. He walks several feet, and his sobs turn into an evil laugh.

FADE TO BLACK

<stage>FADE IN</stage>

Sideshow Bob sits with several promotional people, each presenting their plans to him.

<stage>PROMOTIONAL PEOPLE</stage>We see your face on key chains. And water-action pens. And snow domes.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>This is all very exciting but I think we'd do well to explore the more upscale market. For example, Sideshow Bob limited-edition prints, collector's plates, commemorative coins...

A Security guard peeks through the door.

<stage>SECURITY GUARD</stage>Uh, some kids are here to see you, Sideshow Bob. They say it's important.

<stage>PROMOTIONAL PEOPLE</stage>Ah, well, we can sign these contracts tomorrow.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Certainly. I take great price in being able to sign my own name.

<stage>PROMOTIONAL PEOPLE</stage>Ha ha, that's a good one. I gotta tell my wife.

They walk out of the room just as <fam>Bart</fam> and <fam>Lisa</fam> walk in.

<stage>LISA</stage>Hi, Sideshow Bob.

<stage>BART</stage>Sideshow Bob, can we ask you a few --- ?

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Forgive me, children. As much as Sideshow Bob would love to chat, he has a show starting in moments. Here you go -- three tickets. Be my guests.

<stage>BART</stage>Uh, okay, but ---

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Come, come. Let's run along.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

The curtains being pulled open to start the show. Sideshow Bob speaks with the audience.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Hello, children. Whom do you love?

<stage>AUDIENCE</stage>Sideshow Bob!

<fam>Bart</fam> is the only one not cheering.

<stage>LISA</stage>Come on, <fam>Bart</fam>. Go with the flow.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>How much do you love me?

<stage>AUDIENCE</stage>With all our hearts!

<stage>BART</stage>About a zillionth as much as I love Krusty.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Today's show promises to be a marvelous celebration of the human spirit. But, first, I regret to say I see a youngster who looks troubled. What's your name, young man?

<stage>BART</stage><fam>Bart</fam> Simpson, sir.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Hmm. Well, perhaps we can shed some light on your problem in a new segment exploring preadolescent turmoil. I call it "Choices."

<stage>BART</stage>I don't think so, sir.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage><fam>Bart</fam>, I'm reaching out to you.

<fam>Bart</fam> reluctantly takes Bob's hands and <fam>Lisa</fam> pushes him forward. Bob and <fam>Bart</fam> sit down on a white couch.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>So what's on your mind, <fam>Bart</fam>? I bet the other children don't accept you.

<stage>BART</stage>True, Sideshow Bob. But that doesn't bother me. You see, my sisters and I have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like Krusty was framed.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Framed?

<stage>BART</stage>Well, the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the Kwik-E-Mart. But Krusty couldn't go near the thing, not with his pacemaker.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Well, you know, <fam>Bart</fam>, as much as I love Krusty, he was never one to take doctor's orders too seriously.

<stage>BART</stage>Well, maybe, but get this. Krusty was illiterate, and the guy who robbed the store was reading the Springfield Review of Books.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Ah, well, <fam>Bart</fam>. The fact is, you don't have to be able to read to enjoy the Springfield Review of Books. Just look at these amusing caricatures of Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag.

<stage>BART</stage>Ha ha, yeah, I guess those are kind of funny.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage><fam>Bart</fam>, children, this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us. But we must get on with our lives. Let's try to remember Krusty not as a hardened criminal, but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car.

<stage>BART</stage>And sh*t you out of a cannon.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>And sh*t me out of a cannon. Yes, we will never forget that, will we? <fam>Bart</fam>, open your heart. I admit I have some mighty big shoes to fill.

The voice begins repeating in <fam>Bart</fam>'s head.

SIDESHOW BOB'<stage>S VOICE</stage>Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill--

In his mind, <fam>Bart</fam> remember the video...how <fam>Homer</fam> steps on "Krusty's" foot.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>In ancient Greece, there was a school of thought called stoicism.

<stage>BART</stage>Wait a minute. You did it!

The audience gasps.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Excuse me?

<fam>Bart</fam> snatches the microphone away.

<stage>BART</stage>Attention, fellow children! Krusty didn't rob that store! Sideshow Bob framed him, and I got proof!

<fam>Bart</fam> picks up a large mallet and slams it painfully into Sideshow Bob's foot.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Ow!! My foot! You lousy, stupid, clumsy --

<stage>BART</stage>See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes, but he's got little feet like all good-hearted people.

<fam>Bart</fam> hits Bob with the mallet on his other leg.

<stage>BART</stage>Sideshow Bob really fills his shoes with big ugly feet.

He takes off the shoe, revealing Bob's "big foot".

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

Police officers Eddie and Lou watch the footage on TV.

<stage>LOU</stage>Kid's right.

<stage>EDDIE</stage>How do you figure we missed that?

<stage>WIGGUM</stage>Get off your duffs, boys. Get down to that studio.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

Sideshow Bob being handcuffed and arrested, while being watched by a massive group of people.

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Yes, I admit it. I hated him! His hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my dignity for years. I played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites. That's why I framed Krusty! And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for these meddling kids.

<stage>BART</stage>Take him away, boys!

<stage>SIDESHOW BOB</stage>Treat kids as equals! They're people too! They're smarter than you think. They were smart enough to catch me!

He is tossed in a van and carted away.

<stage>DISSOLVE TO</stage>

<fam>Bart</fam> leading Krusty out of the courthouse with <fam>Homer</fam> by his side.

<stage>WIGGUM</stage>Well, we made...a...terrible, terrible mistake. It won't happen again.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>It better not, you dimwit!

<stage>HOMER</stage>Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated.

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Well, the important thing is that I regain the trust of the children. But there was one boy who trusted me all along. <fam>Bart</fam>?

<stage>BART</stage>Yes, sir?

<stage>KRUSTY</stage>Thank you.

He and <fam>Bart</fam> shake hands and pose for a camera. It turns into a black and white picture which <fam>Bart</fam> is hammering to his bedroom wall.

He jumps into bed, his room once again stocked only with Krusty toys.

Smiling, he reaches and turns off the lights.
