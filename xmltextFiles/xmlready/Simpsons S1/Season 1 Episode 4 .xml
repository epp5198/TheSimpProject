<fam>Lisa</fam>: Yeah!

<fam>Bart</fam>: Oh, yeah?

<fam>Lisa</fam>: Yeah.

<fam>Bart</fam>: Oh, yeah?

<fam>Lisa</fam>: Yeah!

<fam>Homer</fam>: Hey, what’s the problem here?

<fam>Lisa</fam>: We were fighting over which one of us loves you more.

<fam>Homer</fam>: You were? (sniffles) Aw, well, go ahead.

<fam>Bart</fam>: You love him more.

<fam>Lisa</fam>: No, you do.

<fam>Bart</fam>: No, I don’t.

<fam>Lisa</fam>: Yes, you do!

<fam>Bart</fam>: No, I don’t.

<fam>Homer</fam>: Look, you better get this all out of your system right now! I don’t want you embarrassing me at my boss’s picnic. Mmm. Marshmallow. (belches)

<fam>Marge</fam>: <fam>Homer</fam>!

<fam>Homer</fam>: I’m trying to get at least some of the unfortunate noises out of my system while I can, <fam>Marge</fam>. I don’t want to embarrass myself at the company picnic.

<fam>Marge</fam>: (disgruntled groan)

<fam>Homer</fam>: Are you sure that’s enough? You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.

<fam>Marge</fam>: Oh, <fam>Homer</fam>, Mr. Burns just said he liked it… once.

<fam>Homer</fam>: <fam>Marge</fam> 

<fam>Homer</fam>: There it is, kids! Stately Burns Manor. Heaven on Earth. Okay, now look, my boss is gonna be at this picnic so I want you to show your father some love and/or respect.

<fam>Lisa</fam>: Tough choice.

<fam>Bart</fam>: I’m thinking respect.

Mr. Burns: Good to see you. Glad you could make it.

Man: Oh, thank you, Mr. Burns, I’m so glad you invited us.

Tom: Not me. I had to miss little league for this.

Man: Quiet, Tom.

Mr. Burns: Oh, please, please don’t fight. Just go out back and have a good time. f*re that man, Smithers. I don’t want him or his unpleasant family to ruin my picnic.

Smithers: He’ll be gone by the tug-of-w*r, sir.

Mr. Burns: Excellent.

<fam>Homer</fam>: Uh, afternoon, Mr. Burns.

Mr. Burns: Hi. Hello, there, uh— uh—

<fam>Homer</fam>: (whispering) Simpson, <fam>Homer</fam>.

Smithers: Here you go, sir.

Mr. Burns: Ah! Oh, yes. Uh, oh, and this must be your lovely wife, <fam>Marge</fam>. Oh, and look at little, uh, <fam>Lisa</fam>. Why she’s growing like a weed. And this must be, uh, Brat.

<fam>Bart</fam>: <fam>Bart</fam>.

<fam>Homer</fam>: Don’t correct the man, Brat. Oh, boss, look what we brought, gelatin desserts.

Mr. Burns: Oh, for the love of Peter. That’s all anybody brought. Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile over there. And… make yourselves at home.

<fam>Bart</fam>: Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself.

<fam>Homer</fam>: Now, you listen to me!

<fam>Bart</fam>: Whoa!

Mr. Burns: Trouble, Simpson?

<fam>Homer</fam>: No. (chuckles) Just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man.

<fam>Homer</fam>: Now remember, as far as anyone knows, we’re a nice, normal family.

<fam>Lisa</fam>: Hey, <fam>Bart</fam>, last one in the fountain’s a rotten egg!

<fam>Bart</fam>: Hey!

<fam>Homer</fam>: D’oh! Be normal! Be normal!

<fam>Marge</fam>: What an adorable little girl.

Woman: (chuckles) Thank you. Why don’t we dump them in the nursery and get a glass of punch?

<fam>Marge</fam>: Oh, I’m not much of a drinker.

Woman: Hey, isn’t that your boy there torturing the swans?

(squawking)

<fam>Homer</fam>: <fam>Bart</fam>!

<fam>Marge</fam>: (groans) Maybe I will take you up on that punch.

<fam>Marge</fam>: Gee, do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?

Woman: You’re right. There.

<fam>Homer</fam>: <fam>Bart</fam>! <fam>Lisa</fam>! (mumbles)

(squawking)

<fam>Homer</fam>: Where are you, kids? Oh!

<fam>Bart</fam>: Whoops.

<fam>Homer</fam>: Got ya!

<fam>Bart</fam>: Whoa, careful, Dad. Blow a gasket, you lose your job.

Smithers: Now hear this: The father/son sack race will begin in five minutes on the north lawn. Participation is mandatory. Repeat, mandatory. That is all.

<fam>Homer</fam>: You remember the rules from last year?

<fam>Bart</fam>: Yeah. Shut my mouth, and let your boss win.

(squawking)

<fam>Bart</fam>: Hey!

Woman 2: I don’t know who to love more: my son, Joshua, who’s captain of the football team; or my daughter, Amber, who got the lead in the school play. Usually, I use their grades as a tiebreaker, but they both got straight A’s this term, so… what’s a mother to do?

<fam>Marge</fam>: Mm-hmm. Well, I sense greatness in my family.

Woman: Your family?

<fam>Marge</fam>: Well, it’s a greatness that others can’t see, but it’s there. And if it’s not true greatness we have, we’re at least average. I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think there’s a little al-key-hol in this punch.

Smithers: Mr. Burns, are you ready?

Mr. Burns: Yes.

Smithers: Are you set?

Mr. Burns: Yes.

Smithers: (whispering) Go, Mr. Burns.

Mr. Burns: (grunting)

TV: The father of the family has worked all day to find this food for his children. Unable to fend for themselves, the baby bald eaglets are dependent on their mother regurgitating the food which he has found.

<fam>Bart</fam>, <fam>Lisa</fam>, &amp; <fam>Marge</fam>: Hey!

<fam>Homer</fam>: Look, everybody. Yesterday was a real eye-opener. We’ve got to do better as a family. So tonight, we’re not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We’re going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family.

<fam>Lisa</fam>: Happy, Dad?

<fam>Homer</fam>: Yes.

<fam>Lisa</fam>: Good. Commence shoveling.

<fam>Homer</fam>: No. We’re going to say grace first.

<fam>Bart</fam>: Okay. Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub.

<fam>Homer</fam>: (groaning) No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now, can the chatter, and bow your heads. (clears throat) Dear Lord, thank you for this microwave bounty, even though we don’t deserve it. I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions. Pardon my French, but they act like savages. Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course, you did. You’re everywhere. You’ why did you smite me with this family?

<fam>Bart</fam>, <fam>Lisa</fam>, &amp; <fam>Marge</fam>: Amen!

<fam>Homer</fam>: No, m not done yet!

<fam>Marge</fam>: But <fam>Homer</fam>, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you bad-mouth us to the man upstairs?

<fam>Homer</fam>: I’m sorry, <fam>Marge</fam>, but sometimes I think we’re the worst family in town.

<fam>Marge</fam>: Maybe we should move to a larger community.

<fam>Homer</fam>: Oh!

<fam>Bart</fam>: Don’t have a cow, Dad.

<fam>Lisa</fam>: The sad truth is, all families are like us.

<fam>Homer</fam>: You think so, huh? Well, thes only one way to find out. Follow me.

<fam>Homer</fam>: Look at that, kids. No fighting. No yelling.

<fam>Lisa</fam>: No belching. The dad has his shirt on.

<fam>Marge</fam>: Look, napkins!

<fam>Bart</fam>: These people are obviously freaks.

<fam>Homer</fam>: Oh, you think so? Well, lets behind for number two.

<fam>Lisa</fam>: What are they doing?

<fam>Marge</fam>: They’re having a conversation. They actually enjoy talking to each other.

<fam>Homer</fam>: I wish I could hear what re saying.

Boy: Papa, I believe I heard some rustling in the bushes.

Boy’s Father: Hmm. I did too. Better get the g*n.

Dr. Monroe: Well, if you had been paying attention, perhaps you would have noticed that your family sees you as a rather stern authority figure, an ogre if you will.

<fam>Marge</fam>: Now, Doctor, that’s not true.

Dr. Monroe: Give me that. Yes, well, that concludes this portion of our treatment.

Dr. Monroe: (scoffs) Don’t be ridiculous. You will be cured, but it’s going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods.
