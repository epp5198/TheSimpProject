The answer is Buenos Aires.Hokkaido!Budapest.!Cleveland!England!Bangkok!People! People! Please.You are forgetting what the Olympics are all about- giving out medals of beautiful gold... so-so silver and shameful bronze.<stage> All Murmuring </stage><stage> Woman </stage> It's so true.I have here a letter from a little girl named <fam>Lisa</fam> Simpson.She says her town might not be important enough to host the Olympics... but she asks if the torch could just pass by... so she can experience the glow that we feel every day.Well, I say we don't bring her the torch.I say we bring her... the Olympic Games!Who is with me?<stage> Cricket Chirps </stage>Well, I don't care. It's my decision.Springfield was shocked today to learn it will host the next Olympics.Economists predict our city will experience the same boom... that Sarajevo enjoyed after the I 984 Games.And it's all because of your letter, <fam>Lisa</fam>.Well, actually, I just wrote it for a school assignment.Everyone else wrote to the Backstreet Boys.To honor the arrival of our foreign friends- and enemies-Channel 6 is sponsoring a contest to find a Springfield Olympic mascot.The winner will join such other memorable mascots... as the Atlanta whatsit and the Montreal vampire.A mascot contest?

Here's my impression of an East German woman."Kees" me, or I'll crush you.<stage> Laughing Hysterically </stage>He says what we're all thinking.I'm not thinking that.Hey, Swiss miss. There's no missin' you, babe.Lay off the cocoa.<stage> Laughter </stage><stage> Mutters in German </stage>Now I'd like to say one last thing to our Olympic representatives.If there was a medal for horrible audiences, you'd get the gold.Peace out.<stage> Loud Feedback </stage><stage> Gasps, Grunts </stage><stage> Tires Screeching </stage>Skinner!Skinner!How could you put this boy on with that horrible material?Well, it really did seem funny in rehearsal.And he didn't even get to his Ubangi routine.<stage> Laughing </stage>Ha, ha, ha.

Where are you from?Huh?Well, I was born in Queens, went to Ball State... then made the move to lntercourse, Pennsylvania.Uh, why do you ask?Don't worry, sir.I'll teach these children some respect for their town.I'm assigning each of you 20 hours of community service.<stage> Groaning, Grumbling </stage>Community service?No, no!Intercourse?What if we refuse?You won't pass to the next grade.I fail to see the thr*at.Skinner! Good idea.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to my vacation at Lake Titicaca.Let's see you make a joke out of that, Mr. Smart Guy.All right, Martin. For your community service... you'll be setting up a midnight basketball program for inner-city street gangs.All right, g*ng. Shirts and skins.Let's hustle.<stage> g*n </stage><stage> Tires Screeching </stage>Milhouse, do you like the beach?Who doesn't?Good.I want you to pick up all this medical waste... that's washed up on the shore here.Ow! I pricked myself.Well, just keep working.You'll prick yourself with the antidote sooner or later.<stage> Sighs </stage>What are ya gonna do to me?<fam>Bart</fam>, not all community service... is g*ng warfare and dangerous infection.And to illustrate that point, here's where you'll be working.The fireworks, candy and puppy dog store?<stage> Puppies Yipping </stage>No, no, no. Next to it.Settle a bet. Boil or mole?<stage> Groans </stage>Okay.Just breathe through your mouth... and don't ask how they're feeling.♪<stage> Muzak </stage><stage> All Groaning </stage><stage> Creaking </stage>Oh, man.<stage> Wheezing Groan </stage><stage> Yelps </stage> Whoa!<stage> Grunts </stage><stage> Dentures Chattering </stage>Aren't you a beautiful-Let's pull his skin.<stage> Yelps </stage>Look at that.Oh, be a dear and snap my support hose to my girdle.<stage> Shuddering </stage>2:00.

I got a bingo! What do I win?A banana.A whole one?Yep.That's the prize? A banana?Their natural mushiness prevents choking and promotes regularity.They're not babies, <fam>Lisa</fam>. Give 'em something fun- like cigars or booze.We tried giving them eggnog at Christmas... but it led to widespread "de-shawling."Well, that's what they get for wearing such tight little shawls.Oh!<stage> Chuckles </stage>Okay. 4:00. Nap time.<stage> All Snoring </stage>You tell 'em when to sleep?<stage> Whispering </stage> Shh. Don't wake them.<stage> Vacuums Whirring </stage>While they sleep, we suck up excess dirt and crumbs.Here you go.
