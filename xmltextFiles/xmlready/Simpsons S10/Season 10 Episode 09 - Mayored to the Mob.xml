It is diet Mr. Pibb.And "B," I- ooh.<stage> Moans </stage>Tell me, how do you feel about 45-year-old virgins who still live with their parents?Comb the Sweet Tarts out of your beard and you're on.Don't try to change me, baby.Welcome, futurists, cyberphiles and the rest of you dateless wonders.<stage> Cheering </stage>And now to push this convention into hyperspace... the man who put the "star" in Star Wars, a real burr under Darth Vader's saddle...Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill!<stage> Cheering </stage><stage> Cheering </stage>Hey, thanks, everybody.You know, I'm here today as Luke Skywalker... but I'm also here to talk about Sprint.As you can see, you stand to save up to I 7 cents a month over the more dependable providers.Aw, talk about Star Wars.<stage> Shouting in Agreement </stage>You stupid nerds!

My whole life has been leading to this moment.Like hell it has. If anybody's gonna play Obi, it's me.Step away, foolish amateurs.Just keep back. Keep out of it. The role is mine.With the acting and the groupies and the "Luke, Luke, save me"... with the light saber and the "vwing, vwing, vwing."That's not how you "vwing." <stage> Shouts </stage>We're doomed. Doomed.<stage> Clamoring </stage>Oh, God. Can't this town go one day without a riot?Ya! Gadzooks! Where are my bodyguards?Is there anything fluffier than a cloud?If there is, I don't wanna know about it.<stage> C-3PO </stage> Oh, dear. Oh, my!Let's cruise.

Back off, you freakin' dweebs.Oh, poor Mark Hamill.<stage> Gasps </stage> That swarm of nerds is gonna k*ll him.<stage> Shouts </stage> Nerds!Get out of there! <stage> Grunting </stage>Mr. Hamill.

Him!Whoo-hoo!<fam>Homer</fam>, I don't think you were listening to what he just-I said, "Whoo-hoo."<stage> Groans </stage>As a bodyguard, your only loyalty is to your protectee.Not to your family. Not to your country. Not to "Moo-hammad."Even during Ramadan?Shut your sass-hole, boy.These melons represent your protectees.Throughout this course, you will protect your personal melon as if it was paying your salary.<stage> Slurping </stage> What?Okay. Listen up. My goal is to assassinate that watermelon.Your job is to take the b*llet. Go!<stage> Gasps </stage><stage> Panting </stage>Go, go, go.!Pow!No!Well, your dive wasn't bad, but I just didn't believe your "No!"I mean, you gotta sell it. Remember, your "No!" is what gets you your next job.Now drop and give me 20.No!Better.You ladies are without a doubt the most sorrowful clique at the dance.Not one of you fit to guard a Russian rock band.<stage> All Sigh </stage>However, your checks have cleared, so you all graduate. Congratulations.<stage> Cheering </stage>And, now, in honor of your achievement... here is the theme song from the hit motion picture, The Bodyguard.♪ <stage> Singing Ballad </stage>Whee-ha!Clear.Oh, for Pete's sake.The pig is in the poke.You know, I really don't care for that code name.<stage> Meow </stage>Look out, <fam>Marge</fam>! Cat!<stage> Screeching </stage>I know you're excited about starting a new job, but could you just relax for now?Hold it. What's your clearance?We just wanna get a snack.Access denied.But, Dad-<stage> Both Groan </stage><fam>Homer</fam>, I don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the children.They'll be fine in half an hour.<stage> Scoffs </stage> That's not the point. And another thing-I asked you to take out the garbage three days ago, and you still haven't-Hmm. Still half an hour till dinner.Oh, well. <stage> Groans </stage> Ow!It's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir.Just remember, you represent the office of the mayor.So always comport yourself in a manner befitting- Quick, honk at that broad.<stage> Honks </stage><stage> Wolf Whistle </stage>Good work, Simpson. I couldn't be happier with the way that went.Hey, <fam>Homer</fam>, I told you not to come round here no more... till you paid your tab, or at least cleaned up that mess you made in the bathroom... that you- Mayor Quimby? <stage> Clears Throat </stage><fam>Homer</fam>, why didn't you say you was with the mayor? Shove off, pukeholes!Get out ofhere. These stools are reserved for the mayor and his cronies.Ha.

Right. Health inspection. That reminds me. Ha!Your change, sir.We're working on that roach situation. I swear to God.Yeah, you should see the hospital.<stage> Clinking </stage>And after Moe's, we went to Krusty Burger, and the mayor got some more change.And I ordered a double-double, but they gave me the double-double-double-double.And then Apu gave the mayor lots of change for-Dad, don't you see what's going on?That "change" was a bribe.Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works.Sure the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time.No, he doesn't. Trains are regulated by the federal Department ofTransportation.And recent studies have shown that-<stage> Groans </stage><fam>Homer</fam>!Thank you, Mayor Quimby, for honoring us with the school milk concession.Well, the good children of Springfield need their milk, and I need my- <stage> Coughs </stage>Please accept this kickback as a token of our esteem.Thank you, Fat Tony. However, in the future...I would prefer a nondescript briefcase to the sack with a dollar sign on it.So, how'd you get the nickname "Legs"?Well, that's an interesting story. <stage> Chuckles </stage>It seems President Kennedy's father was-Whoo! Mini cannoli.Hey, I called that.I saw it first. Come back here. <stage> Growls </stage> Hmm, milking room.I hope you cows are decent.<stage> Loud Squeaking </stage><stage> Gasps </stage> Crap on a crust!<stage> Groans </stage><stage> Squeaking </stage><stage> Yelps </stage> They're milking rats.Milking rats!Rats?

No!Hey! My milk. I traded my math book for that.Dad, what a nice surprise.<stage> Kissing Sounds </stage><stage> Disgusted Sounds </stage>Get that away from me. Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk... ever.Can I still drink it?Go nuts.All right! <stage> Loud Gulping </stage><stage> Gagging </stage>You monster! How could you do that to the children?Those wacky gangsters. What are you gonna do?And to think I respected you... and defended you.You wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!<stage> Gasping, Shouting </stage><stage> Gasps </stage> Okay. We'll call it even.Oh, my God! I k*ll the mayor. All right, stay calm.I'll just use the body to stage an elaborate farce a la Weekend at Bernie's and-Help. Help.<stage>/i</stage><stage> Gasps </stage>His corpse is climbing the building.I'm alive, you idiot.Pull me in.Okay. Wait a second.I'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.But the gangsters will k*ll me.You're forgetting. You've got the best bodyguard in the business.Now, promise or I'll let you fall to your death.All right, all right. I promise.Shake on it.<stage> Shouts </stage><stage> Horn Honks </stage>Relax, you're in good hands. Now, come on. I'll pull you up.Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Not so fast.

Read 'em and weep.Not so fast. Seven queens.Freeze, goombahs.We're shutting you down, you filthy I-talians.It's ltalian-Americans.Right, right. Filthy I-talian-Americans.Gentlemen, if you would simply consult my dear friend Mayor Quimby...I am confident this can be-Not this time, Fat Tony.The mayor's office is not for sale.<stage> All Laughing </stage>Can you, uh, edit out the laughs?I am not so much disappointed as I am blinded with rage.Ooh, the Mafia guy's all mad.Oh, what are you gonna do, call your godfather, huh?"Oh, Godfather"- <stage> Whimpering </stage>Break it down.<stage> Grunting </stage><stage> Rats Squeaking </stage>It's pure. Pull the plug, boys.Run free, little vermin. The city is yours.And so, as the rats' milk is returned to the sewers- <stage> Meowing </stage> the circle of life is complete.Fat Tony, do you have any comment?I don't get it.Everyone loves rats, but they don't wanna drink the rats' milk?Hmm. Any words for the mayor?Hello, Mayor Quimby. I would like to remind you that accidents will happen... like the k*ll of you by us.Aren't you scared, Dad? I mean, if I were Fat Tony and, God willing, some day I will be...I'd just be stewing in my jail cell, getting madder and madder.Oh, don't worry about that, boy. He's already out on bail.Well, I'm off to work.You're guarding the mayor tonight?After Fat Tony swore revenge?It's my duty, <fam>Marge</fam>. Besides, those mobsters don't scare me.<fam>Bart</fam>, would you go start Daddy's car?<fam>Homer</fam>!What? There's nothing to worry about.Well, then you start it.All right. Fine.

You're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?No, no. I truly do want to stay home with the- <stage> Sighs </stage> wife.You've gotta snap out of this funk, Mayor.I'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters.Excuse me.<stage> Drawn-out </stage> Yes?Do you have a table for the mayor?Yes!Why do you talk that way?I had a stroke.Dear Lord, please make tonight's production better than Othello with Peter Marshall.<stage> <fam>Homer</fam> </stage> Okay, Mr. Burns, Fat Tony, what's-his-name<stage>/i</stage>- Fat Tony.!<stage> Gasps </stage> All right, Fat Tony. If it's trouble with Quimby you're after-Please.

That's the kiss of death.Oh, no! Wait. Maybe I didn't do it right.Never mind that. Just go patrol the perimeter.Ah, au gratin potatoes. That's a quality side.No!Potatoes are clean.
