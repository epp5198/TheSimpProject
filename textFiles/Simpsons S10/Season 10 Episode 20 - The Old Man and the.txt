Hmm.

Hey.

Ah, but Paris would make a tres bon site for the next Olympic Games.

And why is that?

We don't have to explain ourselves to the likes of you!

I await your reply.

I recommend Moscow, where the American dollar buys seven rubles.

[ Pager Beeps ]

Twelve rubles.

[ Beeping Continues ]

Sixty rubles. I ,000 rubles! I must go!

I suggest Motown.

Detroit.

No, no. Mongolia Town- home of the Motown sound.

You are all crazy! The answer is Buenos Aires.

People! People! Please.

You are forgetting what the Olympics are all about- giving out medals of beautiful gold... so-so silver and shameful bronze.

[ All Murmuring ]

[ Woman ] It's so true.

I have here a letter from a little girl named Lisa Simpson.

She says her town might not be important enough to host the Olympics... but she asks if the torch could just pass by... so she can experience the glow that we feel every day.

Well, I say we don't bring her the torch.

I say we bring her... the Olympic Games!

Who is with me?

[ Cricket Chirps ]

Well, I don't care. It's my decision.

Springfield was shocked today to learn it will host the next Olympics.

Economists predict our city will experience the same boom... that Sarajevo enjoyed after the I 984 Games.

And it's all because of your letter, Lisa.

Well, actually, I just wrote it for a school assignment.

Everyone else wrote to the Backstreet Boys.

To honor the arrival of our foreign friends- and enemies-

Channel 6 is sponsoring a contest to find a Springfield Olympic mascot.

The winner will join such other memorable mascots... as the Atlanta whatsit and the Montreal vampire.

A mascot contest? I'm sure to win that- unless one of you jinxes me.

No one's gonna jinx you, Homer. In fact, we're rooting for you.

Yeah. Go for the gold, Dad.

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Well, you said I couldn't do it, but here it is.

Meet Abby, the Olympic Tabby!

[ Bart ] How'd you get the eyes to move?

[ Plaintive Meowing ]

[ Gasps ] You papier-mached my cat?

Just for the prototype, honey.

[ Meows ]

[ Hisses ]

[ Yelps ]

Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a backup.

How about a big Olympic hello for Springy- the Springfield spring!

[ Bart ] Those aren't the dog's eyes, are they?

Hey, that's cute.

Good work, Dad.

It's fun for the whole family.

And the ends are razor sharp- to protect our nation and its interests.

Ow!

God bless America.

I have never seen such a clean sewer.

[ Chuckles ]

And we are positively inspired by your solar power plant.

Yes. Love that sun, man.

We will do anything, including but not limited to anything... to make your stay here tolerable.

Yes. You'll be completely above the law.

Uh, women, g*n, cash- whatever you need. It's yours.

Well, we still love you, Ciggy.

Thank you, thank you.

So, uh, you're from Russia, huh?

How ya doin', Germany? Here's my impression of an East German woman.

I'm not thinking that.

Hey, Swiss miss. There's no missin' you, babe.

If there was a medal for horrible audiences, you'd get the gold.

How could you put this boy on with that horrible material?

Well, it really did seem funny in rehearsal.

And he didn't even get to his Ubangi routine.

[ Laughing ]

Ha, ha, ha. Laugh it up, ya punks.

'Cause you and Jan Murray here just cost our town the Olympics.

Hey, Chalmers. Where are you from?

Huh?

Well, I was born in Queens, went to Ball State... then made the move to lntercourse, Pennsylvania.

Uh, why do you ask?

Don't worry, sir.

I'll teach these children some respect for their town.

I'm assigning each of you 20 hours of community service.

[ Groaning, Grumbling ]

Community service?

No, no!

Intercourse?

What if we refuse?

You won't pass to the next grade.

I fail to see the thr*at.

Skinner! Good idea.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to my vacation at Lake Titicaca.

Let's see you make a joke out of that, Mr. Smart Guy.

All right, Martin. For your community service... you'll be setting up a midnight basketball program for inner-city street gangs.

All right, g*ng. Shirts and skins.

Let's hustle.

[ g*n ]

[ Tires Screeching ]

Milhouse, do you like the beach?

Who doesn't?

Good.

I want you to pick up all this medical waste... that's washed up on the shore here.

Ow! I pricked myself.

Well, just keep working.

You'll prick yourself with the antidote sooner or later.

[ Sighs ]

What are ya gonna do to me?

Bart, not all community service... is g*ng warfare and dangerous infection.

And to illustrate that point, here's where you'll be working.

The fireworks, candy and puppy dog store?

[ Puppies Yipping ]

No, no, no. Next to it.

Settle a bet. Boil or mole?

Their natural mushiness prevents choking and promotes regularity.

They're not babies, Lisa. Give 'em something fun- like cigars or booze.

We tried giving them eggnog at Christmas... but it led to widespread "de-shawling."

Well, that's what they get for wearing such tight little shawls.

Oh!

[ Chuckles ]


Okay. 4:00. Nap time.

[ All Snoring ]

You tell 'em when to sleep?

[ Whispering ] Shh. Don't wake them.

[ Vacuums Whirring ]

While they sleep, we suck up excess dirt and crumbs.

Here you go. Make sure you get into every crevice.

Cool.

Grampa. Homer.

Grampa. Homer.

Don't play with the faces.

So, Bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?

That place sucks. The nurses don't let Grampa do anything.

They practically chew his food for him.

Lucky stiff. I'm workin' my ass off here.

Good steak, honey.

The elderly aren't like you or me, Bart.

They thrive on consistency, predictability... and a life with no surprises.

Sounds good to me.

You'll need to ask her for five dollars to buy Mr. Bouncy Best Friend.

And I'm gonna rip you a new I.V. hole.

I'm just trying to liven things up around here.

Excuse me. But when those pirates boarded...

I swallowed my wedding ring for safekeeping.

Get me some ipecac. I'd like to expunge it.

Okay, she's gone. Let's break out of here and have some fun.

Shouldn't we ask someone first?
