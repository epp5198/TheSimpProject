[ Beeping ]

[ Tires Screeching ]

D'oh! [ Screams ]

Mmm.

[ Chuckles ] So I said to that nurse...

"You can take your free tetanus sh*t and shove it."

You told her, Dad.

You better- [ Bones Crack ] believe I did.

[ Grunting ]

You still haven't told us why Lenny bit you.

Well, I really gave him no choice. You see-

Lousy meat-eating scum.

Huh?

Not you.

[ Chomping ]

I'm going over to protest this disgusting new restaurant called The Slaughterhouse.

It's decorated with hanging steer carcasses and a fountain of blood.

Oh, I heard about that place on The Red Grocer.

The worst part is you pick out your own cow... and they k*ll it right in front of you.

Well, maybe the animals don't mind, honey.

They might enjoy being the center of attention.

I think I read somewhere that cows like being k*ll.

Wait! There's a place like that in Springfield?

Then why are we eating this crap?

[ Clanging ]

Come on, everybody. We're going to The Slaughterhouse.

You didn't need to knock the food on the floor.

Didn't I?

[ Chainsaw Revving ]

[ Mooing ]

Wow! It's even more wonderful than Lisa said.

Oh, whoa. A complimentary basket of hooves.

Mmm. Beef salad, beef on the cob, beef-fried beef-

Is there anything on the menu that isn't meat?

Ha. Not likely.

Cool.

Even this menu is made of meat. It's an entire chicken pounded flat.

How clever. The kids' menu is on the beak.

Hmm, I think I'll take- oh, that one.

[ g*n ]

[ Thud ]

No. He's a bit listless, isn't he?

Give me- ooh, that spirited fellow.

[ g*n ]

[ Thud ]

He didn't put up much of a fight. Why don't you pick one for me?

[ g*n ]

[ Thud ]

On second thought, I'll just have a glass of milk... from that cow.

Hmm?

[ g*n ]

[ Thud ]

[ Homer ] Wait a minute. Is this the biggest steak you've got?

Seventy-two ounces? I thought this was supposed to be a steak house... not a little girlie, underpantsie, pink-doily, tea-party place.

Well, there is one steak that's only available by special request.

We call it "Sirloin-a-Lot." It's the size of a boogie board.

Ooh! I'll have that one. And to drink, meatballs.

Very good, sir.

[ Dinging ]

Ladies and gentlemen, this brave man has accepted the "Sirloin-a-Lot" challenge.

He will pit his stomach against 1 6 pounds of indomitable tenderloin.

[ People Oohing ]

They like me because I'm brave.

Only two people have ever finished the whole thing.

If you want some friendly advice, pal...

I wouldn't tackle the big one right away.

Oh, yeah? What do you know about it?

Hmm?

It's you! You're him!

You're Tony Randall!

[ Chuckles ] Red Barclay's my name. I'm a trucker.

And I've eaten steaks from coast to coast with taters and toast.

Take my advice. This one's not for greenhorns.

Greenhorn? Who's a greenhorn? What's a greenhorn?

It's an insult. Sock him, Dad. Sock everybody.

Oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore, Mr. No-Belly.

Mr. Hasn't-Got-A-Belly.

Well, I have just finished a whole lamb.

But, uh, I reckon I could take you to school. You're on, boy.

♪[ Fanfare ]

[ Grunting ]

[ Drooling ]

Is it safe to eat that much food, Dr. Hibbert?

You know, I wouldn't have thought so before I bought I 2% percent of this restaurant... but now I feel a balanced diet can include the occasional eating contest.

But what if he chokes?

Oh, not to worry.

We have the latest Heimlich machine.

[ Gagging ]

On your left, the pride of the American trucking industry...

"Reliable" Red Barclay!

[ Cheering, Applause ]

And an your right, Homer somebody.

Go, Dad! Go, go, go!

Yeah! Come on, Homie!

Gluttons, to your marks, and gorge!

Chew, chew, chew! Chew, chew, chew!

Ooh, dear.

No, Homer! Don't fill up on bread!

Huh? Oh, right! The steak!

[ Chomping ]

Come on, Dad. Pick up the pace. Chew and swallow. No savoring.

Must eat beef. Must defeat guy I just met.

[ Chomping ]

[ Chomping ]

So much steak.

Lungs filling. Sinuses packed with meat.

Come on, Dad. Just I 2 more pounds.

[ Groaning ]

Oh, humans are so ridiculous.

He's not even halfway through Walter and he's already hallucinating.

[ Both Laughing ]

Lousy drunks! I'll show them!

[ Groaning ]

What's happening to me?

There's still food, but I don't want to eat it.

I've become everything I've ever hated. [ Sobbing ]

Mmm.

[ Cheering, Applause ]

The winner and still champion, "Reliable" Red Barclay!

My hat's off to you, Red. You're a true American hero.

And you did it with style and dignity. And- Hey!

You're not breathing.

Don't people usually breathe?

This man is d*ad. Looks to me like beef poisoning.

[ All Gasping ]

Probably from some other restaurant.

[ All Sighing ]

[ Man ] Pass the ribs.

[ Grunting ]

You'd better take one of these too. He's eaten quite a lot.

[ Tires Squealing ]

There goes the finest trucker who ever lived.

He called me greenhorn.

I called him Tony Randall. It was a thing we had.

In 38 years, he never missed a shipment.

But I guess this is one delivery old Red won't be making.

Oh, yes, he will. And on time too.

Oh, no. Homer, no.

I've got to, honey. I owe it to old Red as both his friend and his k*ll.

Oh, let me go with you, Dad.

Don't you have school?

Don't you have work?

Ah, touche!

Bye, Marge!

Aren't you gonna say bye?

Good-bye, Homer.

That didn't sound like you meant it.

Oh, all right.

Good-bye, sweetheart. Have a nice trip.

That's more like it. So long, suckers!

[ Homer Grunting ]

[ Grinding Continues ]

[ Grunting ] Come on!

[ Grinding ]

Ah, now I'm getting the hang of this thing.

I don't know why I didn't become a trucker before.

You're not really a trucker now.

Oh, yeah? My left arm says different.

Well, according to Red's schedule, we have to make it to Atlanta in three days.

Piece of cake. Just need a little truck-driving music.

Yeah. The open road.

Ah, that little punk. I'll teach him some manners!

No, Dad! He wants you to blow your horn.

Oh.

Lisa, we got another postcard from your father.

Lisa, we got another postcard from your father.

Wow! Dad and Bart have been everywhere.

They've eaten submarine sandwiches, grinders and hoagies.

It's not fair. Your father always gets to have such exciting adventures.

Well, you came to the right place.

Sure thing, Gwen.

I'll be right back with your pie, hon.

Ah, that's a nice, friendly gal.

Yeah.

Wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop?

Watching all the people come and go.

You could have a different best friend every day.

I suppose.

Great. Now write your mother and tell her the marriage is off.

And then when the paperwork is done, I'll make Gwen my wife.

Will that be all, sweetie?

For now.

The light's on. All systems are ding-dong.

Come on, Mom. Let's take it for a test drive.

It's not a toy, Lisa. We'll just have to wait until someone comes.

Anyone? Anyone at all?

Oh! Milhouse is selling seeds, and he's coming this way-

Oh, the birds got him.

[ Screaming ] Not the face!

If your father was here, there'd be process servers, repo men... and bounty hunters to b*at the band.

Wait! People are coming!

I think they're Jehovah's Witnesses.

Yes!

Wait, Marlin. You know, I just had a thought.

Maybe we're bothering people by trying to change their religion.

What if we don't have all the answers?

You're right, Nureen. Let's go get real jobs.

Oh. I would have feigned interest.

Uh, yeah. I need something that'll keep me awake, alert and reckless all night long.

Well, Congress is racing back to Washington to outlaw these.

Hey, you can't that many pep pills at once.

No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.

You know, this thing.

With this baby driving your truck for you... all you gotta do is sit back and feel your ass grow.

The trucks drive themselves?

Shh! Hey, hey. Shh!

Didn't your union rep tell you about the scam we got going?

I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the rep that often.

All right, listen, pal. Here's the deal.

You stumbled on the secret that only truck drivers are supposed to know.

Hey, pay attention and stop looking at that squirrel.

We get 40 bucks an hour to drive these rigs.

Do you think anybody would hire us if they knew we weren't really driving the trucks?

See that you do.

Hey, Bart. Watch me run down this old lady.

Dad, no!

And if scaring old ladies don't float your boat, watch this! [ Grunts ]

Wow! You're right, Dad. It is windy!

Hey, look. Nobody's driving.

Well, will wonders never cease?

Relax, everybody. The Navi-Tron Auto-Drive System is driving the truck for me.

But keep it a secret. It's a big scam, okay?

Looks like we got us a I 0-38.

Uh, I 0-38. Uh, let's see.

No! No.

Using our hands and our wits.

Yeah, sure it's hard work and it's lonely as hell.

Nah. Let's just find some other scam.

Yep, you're gonna make it, Dad.
