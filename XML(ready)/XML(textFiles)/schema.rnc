# Before you were only permitting either text OR one of these elements, but you have all of them.
# Writing mixed{} content with a parenthetical grouping like this and using 
# mixed{(epTitle, szn, epNum)+ means you expect the elements each to appear in exactly that sequence.
# I think, if I know your files, that's what you want? Setting the rule like this will help you see which
# files are missing the elements anyway! But in case you do NOT expect to see the elements in that order, 
# here's is a more flexible construction to use insetad for <ep>:
# # ep = element ep {mixed{(epTitle | szn | epNum)*}}
# the * at the end (element1 | element2 | element3)*  means zero or more of any these elements in any order, or
# not at all!
