<stage>FADE IN</stage>

We begin with an outside sh*t of the house.

Inside, <fam>Marge</fam> hums as she brushes her teeth.

<stage>MARGE</stage>So how was the office birthday party?It turns out <fam>Homer</fam> is right behind her.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was this thick.

He holds out two fingers and shows her the size.

<stage>HOMER</stage>And Eugene Fisk -- my poor sucker of an assistant -- didn't know the fruit punch was spiked and he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance. <stage>(laughs)</stage>.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Does this girl like him?

<stage>HOMER</stage>I have to warn you, <fam>Marge</fam>. I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly.

He taps her jokingly on the shoulder and chuckles.

<stage>MARGE</stage><fam>Homer</fam>.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Just keeping you on your toes, baby.

239 pounds.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Two hundred and thirty nine pounds! Oh, I'm a blimp! Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning.He starts doing weak arm exercises when <fam>Marge</fam> grabs him around his neck.

<stage>MARGE</stage>You're not a blimp, <fam>Homer</fam>. You're my big, cuddly teddy bear.

They kiss.

<stage>DISSOLVE TO</stage>

<fam>Bart</fam> looks at a fitness advertisement. It shows a small, scrawny guy being transformed into a tough, muscular, fit guy in a before and after picture.

<stage>BART</stage>Aw, baloney.

He looks next a X-Ray TV glasses ad.

<stage>BART</stage>Yeah, right.

Next up is a hyp-no Coin.

<stage>BART</stage>Oh, give me a break.

He looks down at a "Genuine spy Camera" Ad. A slogan beneath it says "Just like the C.I.A. uses!!!"

<stage>BART</stage>Wow, cool, man!

He cuts the ad out. He grabs a hammer and breaks his piggy bank <stage>(which already has cracks from previous beatings)</stage> to collect several coins.

He slides everything into an envelope, runs out, and drops it into a mailbox.

FADE OUT

<stage>FADE IN</stage>

A sh*t of the house. A subhead says "Six months later".

Inside, <fam>Homer</fam> gargles some kind of mouthwash in the bathroom. He stands on the scale and looks down. He spits out the mouthwash.<stage>HOMER</stage>Oh no! Two hundred and thirty nine pounds? I'm a whale! Why was I cursed with this weakness for snack treats?

He looks at himself in the mirror.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Well, from now on, exercise every morning, <fam>Homer</fam>.

Once again, he starts doing weird exercises when <fam>Marge</fam> walks in from behind.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Ooh. Don't strain yourself, dear.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Good idea, <fam>Marge</fam>.

He stops.

<stage>HOMER</stage>By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance.

<stage>MARGE</stage><fam>Homer</fam>, is this some kind of stag party?

<stage>HOMER</stage>No, no, <fam>Marge</fam>. It's gonna be very classy. A tea-and-crumpets kind of thing.

<fam>Homer</fam> begins shaving.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Hmm. Eugene Fisk. Isn't he your assistant?

<stage>HOMER</stage>No! My supervisor.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Didn't he used to be your assistant?

<stage>HOMER</stage>Hey, what is this, the Spanish Inquisition?!

<stage>MARGE</stage>Sorry, <fam>Homer</fam>.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

<fam>Bart</fam> and <fam>Lisa</fam> watching TV on the family couch. <fam>Lisa</fam> reads a book as the doorbell rings.

<stage>BART</stage>Uh-oh, it's the "fe-mailman".

<stage>LISA</stage>Female carrier, <fam>Bart</fam>.

<fam>Bart</fam> opens the door.

<stage>BART</stage>Lady, where's my spy camera?

BART +<stage> LADY MAILMAN</stage>Where's my spy camera?

<stage>LADY MAILMAN</stage>Every day for the last six months---

<stage>BART</stage>Where's my spy camera? Where is my spy camera?

BART +<stage> LADY MAILMAN</stage>Where's my spy camera? Where's my spy camera?!

<stage>LADY MAILMAN</stage>Here's your stupid spy camera!

She shoves a small box into his chest.

<stage>BART</stage>Oh. Thanks, ma'am.

He shuts the door on her and begins opening the box on the floor.

<stage>BART</stage>Whoa, man. Look at the size of this thing. I wonder if it really works...He stares it and takes a picture of himself. Looks fine.

<stage>BART</stage>Cause I got a lot of spying to do.

He looks mischievously upstairs.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

<fam>Homer</fam> exercising in the bathroom. <fam>Bart</fam> opens the door and snaps a picture.

<stage>HOMER</stage><fam>Bart</fam>! What are you doing?

<stage>BART</stage>Sorry, Dad. The answer to that is top secret.

<fam>Bart</fam> runs out as <fam>Homer</fam> grumbles. <fam>Bart</fam> proceeds to the parent's bedroom where a sound of a razor is heard.He peeks in and takes a sh*t of <fam>Marge</fam> shaving her armpits. Ugh.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Ooh. Oh, <fam>Bart</fam>.

<stage>BART</stage>What?

<stage>MARGE</stage>Go take some wildlife pictures or something.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

A bunch of bushes from which <fam>Bart</fam> emerges. He takes a picture of a d*ad rat or another animal that has been run over and has tire tracks on it.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

<fam>Bart</fam>'s room, where <fam>Bart</fam> has his shorts down and his camera behind him. <fam>Lisa</fam> walks in.

<stage>LISA</stage>Mom, <fam>Bart</fam> was taking a picture of his butt.

<fam>Bart</fam> quickly fastens his shorts as <fam>Marge</fam> walks in.

<stage>BART</stage>Oh, sure. Like I'm really gonna take a picture of my butt.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Oh, stop it, you two. And put on some nice clothes. Since it's just the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at the Rusty Barnacle.

<stage>LISA</stage>Yay, fried shrimp!

<stage>BART</stage>Aw, mom, can't we just grab a burger at--? Only four of us? Who escaped?

<stage>MARGE</stage>Your father. He's having a boy's night out.

<stage>DISSOLVE TO</stage>

<fam>Homer</fam> being poured a mug of beer. Lenny, Carl, and a bunch of coworkers sit nearby.

Eugene's father makes a speech.

EUGENE'<stage>S FATHER</stage>Just as I was asking myself "Where did my seven year old boy get the money for a father's day present?", I opened the box. And inside was little Eugene's baseball glove. He had given me the one thing that mattered most to him in the whole world. Eugene, when I see you -- the one thing that matters most to me in the whole world -- married tomorrow, I'm going to know just how you felt that day.

<stage>EUGENE</stage>I love you, Dad.

EUGENE'<stage>S FATHER</stage>I love you, son.

The two hug. Everybody continues drinking. Smoke fills the air as well.

HOMER <stage>(bored)</stage>: Where am I, the planet Cornball?

<stage>CARL</stage>Hey, don't worry, things are gonna pick up once the entertainment gets here.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Ooh, entertainment.

<stage>OTHER PERSON</stage>Yes, sir.

<fam>Homer</fam> and Lenny clink their glasses.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

The Rusty Barnacle, where a waitress dressed like a pirate leads a couple to a table.

On the other side, the Simpsons sit with their pirate waiter.

<stage>WAITER</stage>Ahoy, I spy the children's menu.

<stage>BART</stage>Ahoy, this place bites.

<stage>MARGE</stage><fam>Bart</fam>.

<stage>WAITER</stage>So what's it gonna be, me little bucko?

<stage>BART</stage>Hmm, let's see. This evening I shall go for the squid platter.

<stage>LISA</stage>Ew.

<stage>BART</stage>With extra tentacles, please.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Oh, <fam>Bart</fam>. Excuse me, sir, the party next door seems to be a little raucous. Could you please ask them to quiet down a little bit?

<stage>WAITER</stage>Aye, aye.

<fam>Bart</fam> fills out a service questionnaire. He checks "Poor" for all the categories.

The waiter walks over to the loud room and walks in. Inside are <fam>Homer</fam> and the rest of his buddies.

<stage>WAITER</stage>Hey, try to keep it down, guys. Okay?

<stage>HOMER</stage>Hey, shut up.

GROUP <stage>(singing)</stage>: Open the door and lie on the floor said Barnacle Bill the sailor.

Back at his table, <fam>Bart</fam> looks over at a sign above him that says "Cod Platter - $4.99.

<stage>BART</stage>Hmm...

He re-arranges the letters so they spell "Cold Pet Rat".

The waiter sets a dish down for <fam>Lisa</fam>.

<stage>WAITER</stage>Here you go. There you are. For the baby.

He sets down individual plates.

<stage>WAITER</stage>And one squid platter, extra tentacles.

He sets the plate down, smiling.

<fam>Bart</fam>'s face turns green in disgust.

<stage>MARGE</stage><fam>Bart</fam>, quit fooling around and eat your dinner.

<stage>LISA</stage>Yeah, eat it, <fam>Bart</fam>.

<stage>BART</stage>Ugh, may I please be excused for a minute?

<stage>MARGE</stage>Okay, but don't dawdle. Your food will get cold.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

Inside the office, where Carl stands near Eugene. Both he and his father look depressed.

<stage>CARL</stage>Okay, Eugene. One last taste of bachelor freedom.Lenny turns on a boombox and middle eastern music plays.

<stage>LENNY</stage>Presenting, Princess Kashmir, queen of the mysterious East.

A stripper waltzes in and starts dancing for the men. Everybody barks and cheers her on.

<stage>LENNY</stage>Now this is what I call a party.

EUGENE'<stage>S FATHER</stage>How do I tell you this, my boy? We're in hell.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Heh, heh, look at him squirm.

<stage>STRIPPER</stage>You care to dance?

<stage>WORKER</stage>She wants you, <fam>Homer</fam>!

<stage>LENNY</stage>Go for it, <fam>Homer</fam>.

Lenny pushes <fam>Homer</fam> on top of the table as she giggles. The two start dancing, <fam>Homer</fam> slightly nervous at first.

<stage>WORKER</stage>Shake his buns.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

<fam>Bart</fam> walks out of the bathroom and hears the noises coming from the other room.

<stage>HOMER</stage>I'm sorry, I don't usually laugh like this.

<fam>Bart</fam> peeks in and gasps. <fam>Homer</fam> doesn't see him.

<stage>BART</stage>Ay <catchphrase>caramba</catchphrase>. Wow, man.

<fam>Bart</fam> takes out his handy dandy little camera and snaps a sh*t.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Oh, this is the most fun I've ever had in my life.

FADE TO BLACK

<stage>FADE IN</stage>

A sh*t of the outside of the Springfield Elementary School.

2: The subtle gray tones recall the work of Helmut Newton.

<stage>MARTIN</stage>Who's the sexy lady, <fam>Bart</fam>?

<stage>BART</stage>Beats me. But the gay dancing with her is my pop.

<stage>ALL</stage>Wow!

STUDENT 3: He brings to mind the later work of Diane Arbus.

<stage>MARTIN</stage><fam>Bart</fam>, I'd really appreciate a print of your masterwork.

<stage>STUDENTS</stage>Yeah. Me too. Come on.

<stage>BART</stage>Sorry, guys. No can do.

<stage>STUDENTS</stage>Oh.

Milhouse comes in from the side.

<stage>MILHOUSE</stage>Come on, <fam>Bart</fam>. You're gonna make me a print, aren't you?

<stage>BART</stage>Will you swear not to let another living soul get a copy of this photo?

<stage>MILHOUSE</stage>Ok.

<stage>BART</stage>Cross your heart and hope to die?

<stage>MILHOUSE</stage>Yep.

<stage>BART</stage>Stick a needle in your eye?

<stage>MILHOUSE</stage>Yep.

<stage>BART</stage>Jam a dagger in your thigh?

<stage>MILHOUSE</stage>Yep.

<stage>BART</stage>Eat a horse manure pie?

<stage>MILHOUSE</stage>Yep.

<stage>BART</stage>Well, okay.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

Milhouse sits with another kid in the library. He taps him with his elbow.

<stage>MILHOUSE</stage>Psst, look what I got.

<stage>KID</stage>Whoa, I gotta have a copy of that.

<stage>MILHOUSE</stage>Sorry.

<stage>KID</stage>Aw, come on.

<stage>MILHOUSE</stage>Well, okay.

The two walk over the copy machine and Milhouse puts a coin in. A copy slides out.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

The playground, where <fam>Bart</fam> hangs upside down on his feet. Another boy walks over.

<stage>BOY</stage>Hey, <fam>Bart</fam>. How come Milhouse gets a copy of your girlie picture and I don't? I thought I was your friend too.

<stage>BART</stage>Well, okay.

The two run over to the copy machine and make a copy.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

Inside a classroom, the boy hands over a copy to another classmate sitting in front of him.

Soon, there is a whole stack of copies being printed and a group of kids take one off of a pile.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

A father holds the picture in front of his son.

<stage>FATHER</stage>Son, why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?

<stage>SON</stage>Sorry, Dad.

The son walks away in shame as the father laughs.

<stage>FATHER</stage>Wait till I show the guys at work this little doozy.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

The photo emerges out of a fax. A man picks it up and speaks on the phone.

MAN <stage>(laughs)</stage>: Mike, this is Al. Just wanted to thank you on the "informative memo" you faxed me. Whoops, here comes the boss. Gotta go.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

Reverend Lovejoy sits at his desk when his assistant walks up.

<stage>ASSISTANT</stage>Reverend Lovejoy, your wife confiscated this from one of the boys in the choir.

Lovejoy looks at it and gasps.

<stage>LOVEJOY</stage>Why this sheep has strayed from my own flock. His name's---

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

Smithers and Burns in their office. Smithers holds the same photo.

<stage>SMITHERS</stage><fam>Homer</fam> Simpson, sir. A low-level employee in sector 7-G.

<stage>BURNS</stage>Simpson, huh? A family man?

<stage>SMITHERS</stage>Wife and three kids, sir.

<stage>BURNS</stage>I'd like to see our self-styled Valentino tomorrow morning, Smithers.

<stage>DISSOLVE TO</stage>

A group of women in a gym stare at the picture taped to the wall. It shows an arrow to <fam>Homer</fam>'s belly and says: "Watch Out!!! Bathing Suit Season is Coming!".

They all snicker as <fam>Marge</fam> walks up.

<stage>MARGE</stage>What are we laughing at?

She gasps and rips the picture off the wall.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>An outside sh*t of the Kwik-E-Mart.

Inside, <fam>Homer</fam> takes out a donut from a shelf. He heads over to Apu.

<stage>HOMER</stage>One glazed and one Scratch-N-Win, please.

<stage>APU</stage>You look familiar, sir. Are you on the television or something?

<stage>HOMER</stage>Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone.

<fam>Homer</fam> scratches his lottery card.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Ooh, Liberty Bell! Another Liberty Bell! One more and I'm a millionaire. Come on, Liberty Bell, please, please, please, please, please, please.

He scratches it and it turns out to be a grape.

<stage>HOMER</stage><catchphrase>Doh</catchphrase>! That purple fruit thing. Where were you yesterday?

Another customer walks into the store.

<stage>CUSTOMER</stage>Hey, hey, lookin' good.

<stage>HOMER</stage>What do you want, pal?

A young boy on a skateboard calls him over.

<stage>SKATEBOARD BOY</stage>Hey, mister. Do dee do do do dee do do.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Well, a "do dee do dee do" to you too, pint size. Jeez, you got a lot of nutcases in here.

<stage>APU</stage>Oh, sir, I've seen things you can't imagine.

A construction worker or plumber or something of that short yells to him as <fam>Homer</fam> leaves.

<stage>CONSTRUCTION WORKER</stage>Hey, hey, hey!

<stage>HOMER</stage>I hear ya, buddy. Whew. Full moon.

<stage>DISSOLVE TO</stage>

<fam>Homer</fam> stops his car at a stoplight. Nearby, a convertible stops and three girls start laughing at him and waving.

HOMER <stage>(chuckles)</stage>: Hmm. Still got it.

<stage>DISSOLVE TO</stage>

<fam>Homer</fam> parks the car and turns off the engine. He whistles as he makes his way to the front door. He walks in and gaps as <fam>Marge</fam> slams the picture into his face.

<stage>MARGE</stage>What is the meaning of this?!!

HOMER <stage>(stammering)</stage>: Meaningless, <fam>Marge</fam>. Don't even attempt to find meaning in it. There's nothing between me and Princess Kashmir.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Princess who?

<stage>BART</stage>Hey, my photo.

MARGE +<stage> HOMER</stage>Your photo?!

<stage>BART</stage>Uh-oh.

<stage>HOMER</stage><catchphrase>Why you little</catchphrase>---!

<stage>MARGE</stage>Why you big---!

She grasps <fam>Homer</fam> around the neck and chokes him.

<stage>MARGE</stage><fam>Bart</fam>, go to your room.

<stage>BART</stage>I'm out of here.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Look, <fam>Marge</fam>, honey, baby, doll. I---.

<stage>MARGE</stage><fam>Homer</fam>, I don't even want to look at you right now.

<stage>HOMER</stage>What are you saying, honey?

She points out to the street.

<stage>HOMER</stage>But where will I sleep?

<stage>MARGE</stage>My suggestion is for you to sleep in the filth you created!

<stage>HOMER</stage>Would a motel be okay?

She slams the door shut on him. <fam>Homer</fam> walks sadly away when the door opens behind him.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Oh, I knew you'd come to your--.

A suitcase hits his face and <fam>Marge</fam> comes out.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Here, if you have any soul left, you'll need these.

She hands him a box of tissues as she sheds a tear. Clothes are strewn all around them.

<stage>MARGE</stage>I know I will.

She goes back into the house and shuts the door.

<fam>Homer</fam> sheds several tears as we...

FADE TO BLACK

<stage>FADE IN</stage>

An outside sh*t of Moe's. Inside, <fam>Homer</fam> sniffles as he drinks a beer and talks with Moe. A sign above him says "Ladies Night - Unescorted Ladies Drink Free".

<stage>MOE</stage>What's the matter, <fam>Homer</fam>? Hottest ladies' night in months and you're not even checking out the action.<stage>HOMER</stage>Oh, Moe. My wife gave me the old heave ho because of some lousy picture.

<stage>MOE</stage>What, this one?

He points to a copy framed on his wall.

<stage>HOMER</stage><catchphrase>Doh</catchphrase>!

Barney leans over.

<stage>BARNEY</stage>So, uh, where are you staying tonight, <fam>Homer</fam>?

<stage>HOMER</stage>Motel, I guess.

<stage>BARNEY</stage>Oh no, no pal of mine is gonna stay in some dingy flophouse.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

Barney opens a door and he and <fam>Homer</fam> enter his apartment. It's a complete mess. There are clothes, wrappers, magazines, and empty beer bottles all over the floor.

<stage>BARNEY</stage>If you get hungry in the middle of the night, there's an open beer in the fridge.

<fam>Homer</fam> looks out a window.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Look, Barney. See the row of tiny lights up there? The middle one is my house. Someone must have left the porch light on.

<stage>BARNEY</stage>Hey, that's rough, pal.

Barney dials a telephone.

<stage>BARNEY</stage>Hello, <fam>Marge</fam>. You left your damn porch light on!

<stage>HOMER</stage>Barney!

<stage>BARNEY</stage><fam>Homer</fam>'s not made of money, you know.

<fam>Homer</fam> steals the phone.

<stage>MARGE</stage>Who is this?

<stage>BARNEY</stage>Don't listen to him, <fam>Marge</fam>. He's--

<stage>MARGE</stage>Oh, it's you.

She hangs up.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Oh.

<stage>BARNEY</stage><fam>Homer</fam>, you're overwrought. Why don't you unwind a little bit? Party down the hall. You know, this apartment complex caters to upscale young singles like me.

He burps loudly.

<stage>HOMER</stage>No, Barn. I just want to crawl into bed.

<stage>BARNEY</stage>Suit yourself, <fam>Homer</fam>. Nighty-night.

Barney walks out as <fam>Homer</fam> opens up his suitcase. He sighs.

DISSOLVE TO;

<fam>Homer</fam> lying on a coach and a table, his eyes open. Music and laughter come from next door.

<stage>DISSOLVE TO</stage>

<fam>Marge</fam> and the kids eating breakfast in the kitchen.

<stage>LISA</stage>I wonder when Dad's coming home.

<fam>Marge</fam> looks over at her, a slightly sad look in her eyes.

<stage>DISSOLVE TO</stage>

An outside sh*t of the Nuclear Power Plant.

Inside, <fam>Homer</fam> drinks a cup of coffee. Smithers comes on the announcement system.

<stage>SMITHERS</stage><fam>Homer</fam> Simpson. <fam>Homer</fam> Simpson. Report at once to Mr. Burns' office.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Oh, no.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

<fam>Homer</fam> sitting in front of Burns in his office.

<stage>BURNS</stage>What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?<stage>HOMER</stage>What do you mean, sir?

Burns holds up the photo.

<stage>BURNS</stage>I mean this.

<fam>Homer</fam> gasps.

2: Oh, that's a good idea. Uh, but April's over at Foxy Boxing tonight.

<fam>Bart</fam> is yanked.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>

<fam>Homer</fam> talking with another manager, from the third club.

MANAGER 3: Just let me say that it is an honor to have Springfield's number one swinger here with us to---

<stage>HOMER</stage>Forget that. I'm teaching my boy a lesson. Is she here or not?

<fam>Bart</fam> desperately tries to get a look but can't.

MANAGER 3: Uh, try Mud City.

<stage>CUT TO</stage>An outside sh*t of Mud City. Inside, <fam>Homer</fam> speaks on the phone.

<stage>HOMER</stage><fam>Marge</fam>! <fam>Marge</fam>! We're gonna try one more place, the Sapphire Lounge. <fam>Bart</fam>! I said look at the floor!

<stage>DISSOLVE TO</stage>

<fam>Bart</fam> and <fam>Homer</fam>'s car sliding up into the parking lot of the Ye Old Ramp Inn.

Inside, <fam>Bart</fam> and <fam>Homer</fam> walk along several performers.

<stage>PERFORMER</stage>He really loves me---

<stage>HOMER</stage>There she is. Hey, Princess. It's me, the guy from the snapshot.

He walks over to her. She is dressed like an angel and quite embarrassed.

<stage>PRINCESS</stage>Oh. Oh, hi.

<stage>STAGE MANAGER</stage>Places, ladies, places. Can I get just a little cooperation? It's show time.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Look, I'm here because I want to apologize for treating you like an object.

<stage>PRINCESS</stage>Uh-huh.

<stage>HOMER</stage>I also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. I want him to meet the women behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings too.

<stage>PRINCESS</stage>Oh, well, okay. But can we make it quick?

<stage>BART</stage>Nice to meet you, ma'am.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Could you tell him a little bit about yourself?

<stage>PRINCESS</stage>Well, uh, my real name is Shawna Tifton.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Uh-huh.

Suddenly, the platform she's on begins rising. This is some kind of play or performance in the inn...and <fam>Homer</fam>'s part of it!

<stage>PRINCESS</stage>My pet peeve is rude people.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Uh-huh.

<stage>PRINCESS</stage>And my turn-ons include silk sheets and a warm fireplace.

<stage>HOMER</stage>Thank you very much, ma'am. We'll be on our---.

He turns around and slips off the edge. He hangs on with one hand. It turns out to be a cage of some sort.

In front of the curtain, performing for the audience, is a singer.

<stage>SINGER</stage>I've heard them say so often
They can love their wives ooh
But I think that's just foolish
Men must have hearts...made of stone
Now my heart is made
Of softer stuff

Behind the curtain, <fam>Homer</fam> still hangs nervously.
