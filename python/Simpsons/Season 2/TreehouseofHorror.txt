Hello, everyone.You know, Halloween is a strangeholiday. I don't understand it.Kids worshiping ghosts,pretending to be devils......things on TV that areinappropriate for children.Things like the next half-hour.Nothing bothers my kids.But tonight's show, which I washmy hands of, is really scary.If you have sensitive kids, maybeyou should tuck them into bed......instead of writingus angry letters.Thanks for your attention.Tree House of HorrorWhat a haul this year.I love Halloween.


Wait a minute.Let's see what the kids are up to.And the policemanon the phone said:"We traced the call. It's comingfrom the floor below you! Get out!"But it was too late.

That's a schoolbook.-Don't worry, you won't learn anything.It's called, The Raven.Once upon a midnight drearyWhile I ponderedWeak and wearyOver many a quaint and curiousVolume of forgotten loreI nodded, nearly nappingSuddenly there came a tappingAs of someone gently rappingAt my chamber door-Just some visitor---I mutteredTapping at my chamber doorOnly this and nothing more-Are we scared yet?-Bart, he's establishing mood.Ah, distinctly I rememberIt is in the bleak DecemberEach dying ember wroughtIts ghost on the floorEagerly I wishedThe morrowVainly I had sought to borrowFrom my books surcease of sorrowSorrow for the lost LenoreOh, Lenore.For the rare and radiant maidenWhom angels name LenoreNameless hereFor evermoreThe silken sad uncertain rustlingOf each curtain thrilled meFilled me with fantastic terrorsNever felt beforeTo still my beating heartI stood repeatingA visitor at my chamber doorAnd nothing moreMy soul grew strongerHesitating then no longer-Sir---Said IOr Madam, truly yourForgiveness I imploreI was napping, and you came rappingAnd so faintly you came tappingTapping at my chamber doorThat I scarce was sure I heard youHere I openedWide the doorThis better be good.Darkness there and nothing moreYou know what's scarier?-What?-Anything!Back into the chamber turningMy soul within me burningSoon again I heard tappingSomething louder than before-Surely---Said ISomething atMy window latticeLet me see what thereat isAnd this mystery exploreI flung a shutterWith a flirt and flutterIn stepped a RavenOf the days of yoreNo obeisance made heNot a minute stayed heMien of lord or ladyPerched above my doorPerched upon a bustJust above my doorPerched and satAnd nothing more-Thy crest be shorn and shaven---I saidArt sure no craven, ghastly ancientRaven wandering from the nightly shore-Tell me what thy name is---Quoth the Raven-Eat my shorts!-He says, "Nevermore."-And that's all he'll ever say.-Okay. Okay.Then methoughtThe air grew denser-Perfumed by some unseen censer-Stupid censer.Swung by SeraphimWhose foot tinkled on the floor-Wretch---I criedGod lent theeBy angels sent theeRespite from thyMemories of LenoreQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepentheAnd forget this lost Lenore-Quoth the Raven---Nevermore-Be that word our sign of parting---I shrieked up startingGet thee into the tempestAnd the night's Plutonian shoreLeave no black plume as a tokenOf the lie thy soul hath spokenLeave my loneliness unbrokenQuit the bust above my doorTake thy beak from out my heartAnd take thy form from off my door-Quoth the Raven---NevermoreTake thy beak from out my heartAnd take thy form from off my doorQuoth the Raven-Nevermore-Why you little--Come back here, you little raven!Nevermore, nevermoreNevermoreThe Raven never flittingStill is sitting, still is sittingOn the pallid bustJust above my chamber doorHis eyes have the seemingOf a demon that is dreamingThe lamplight o'er him streamingThrows his shadow on the floorMy soul from out that shadowThat lies floating on the floorShall be liftedNevermoreLisa, that wasn't scary.Not even for a poem.It was written in 1845.Maybe people were easier to scare.Like Friday the 13th Part I.It's pretty tame by today's standards.Children, bedtime!I guess I'll have no troublegetting to sleep tonight.Oh, no, Marge. Come on, please.I'm not sleeping with the lights on.They're just children's stories.They can't hurt you.Oh, I hate Halloween!
