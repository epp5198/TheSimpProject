- Did you unscrew the Phillips heads?- Check.- Did you unscrew all the flat heads?- Yep. And now we wait.Now, go hide the evidencewhile I walk around saying:"What happened?Who would do such a thing?"I'll return these to the shop room....What's left of it.- Don't tell him I'm here.- I know you're there, Skinner!I'd recognize those discoloredHush Puppies anywhere.Hear that? He thinksmy Try'N'Save brand Shush Muttsare genuine Hush Puppies.We've got the "how,"and we've got the "who,"but not the "why."


Here it is.Hard to believe one ladcan cause all this mayhem.Particularly a lad who failed"Introduction to Unscrewing."And I don't buythis "lone prankster" theory.I think there was a second "funman."And if you don't identify him,you're looking at a week's suspension.A nickel?You realize, if you're suspended,you'll be missing...Taco Wednesday.Crunchy shell, ground beef,lettuce,mild sauce, and of course,shredded cheddar cheese!I'll never tell.Then consider yourself suspended,mister.


Willie, take him to the big house...where he lives.Let's go, lad.Suspended boy walking!Thanks for not selling me out.This really sucks, Bart.I'm grounded, and spend all daylistening to my dadyell at "Mad Money"with Jim Cramer.You said tech stockswere bulletproof!Look, I gotta go.But don't worry,I'll visit you every day. I promise.Bart, you're a true friend.I'm glad they suspended Milhouse.He's a bad influence on you.You know, I thinkMilhouse is El Barto.And now,you're gonna visit your grampawhile I park around the cornerand take a nap.So, Grampa,not like I'm anxious to go,but I've been here 10 minutes,which is like 7 hours in kid years.It's her! The little girlwho doesn't recoil at the sight of us!Hi, guys.I brought cookies.Chocolate chip for Donald,low sodium for Abe,not-made-by-immigrants for Samand imaginary for Major Preston.With this cookie I can buy backPrivate O'Malley from the Zulus.I think it is so coolwhat you're doing.So, what's the gag?You put ex-lax in the cookies,then just sit backand watch the fireworks?- I would never do that.- Oh, right.I was thinking of other thingsthat are hilarious.Like. Things that you thinkare funny.Those are funny.- I'm Bart.- I'm Jenny.She had more curvesthan a Hot Wheels track.Well, she didn't yet,but she would after puberty.Oh, my God.How long was I zoned out?Bart, this is my Aunt Belle.We dress alike. Isn't that cute?Math, done. Pine cone, collected.Permission slip, signed.Now, time for a break.A little social studies."What will Springfield be likein 50 years?"Let's see what the computer says.That's horrible. What else?Oh, my God!It just gets worse and worse.So, who's the special someone?Jenny. Fifth grade girl.She gets to use the real scissors.Nice.When she talks to me,I feel like a better person.Powerful stuff.You'd better claim her as your own.Punch her in her arm,or if you're really serious,stick gum in her hair.Here, I always come prepared.Take two.You might get lucky.- Hey, Jenny.- Hi, Bart.Boy, you make it look effortless.And that kid's giving you zero pump.You know what a girl likes to hear.Seal the deal!Punch her! Punch her!Punch her!Do you want to go on a picnic tomorrow?You'd love my PB and J.The secret is, no PB, double J.It's a date.- Willie, I've got a girlfriend!- Really?Well, I do, too!She's... a bikini model from Sweden.That's great.Willie, darling, come back to bed.- Don't you love me?- Don't compete with my job, Inga.You'll never win.And now, Ralph Wiggumwill read his essayon "Springfield in 50 Years.""In 50 years,the vacuum cleaner will be quietand not scary."Next, we have Lisa Simpson.Ralph, how I envy your optimism!There is no Springfield,50 years in the future!With global warming trapping the CO2inside our poisonous atmosphere,our super-heated oceans will rise,drowning our lowlands,leaving what's left of humanitybaking in desertsthat once fed the world!And in the new Nineveh,darkness falls.Lisa, your outburst was either a signof deep emotional imbalance,or a passionate responseto a sobering truth.Luckily, the treatment for bothis intensive therapy.What's therapy going to do for mewhen the world is in ashes?I don't know.But when you go,could you returnthis Sports Illustrated for me?Someone must have...put it in my bag.They do that, you know.They're always putting things in my bag!So, you visit old folks,How else do you make the worlda better place?I spend a lot of timeworking with a mentally-challenged guy.Wait, here he is now!- Lookin' good, Homer!- Boy.- He seems pretty high-functioning.- Just wait.Don't shake your fist at me!I don't want any trouble.Come on. Here, just take my wallet.Leave me alone, okay?Do you know who elsewas really into rowboats? Jesus.And he could've turned his rowboatinto a jet ski,but he didn't. Good guy.Cheese and crackers!

It's love.- I guess you found your Abigail Adams.- My who?So I'll be on my way.I can see I'm the fifth wheelon this bicyclewith training wheels.But the next time I see you two,I might not be ableto hold my tongue.It's really quite difficult.Reverend, care for someof my devils food cake?Is that really devils food?No, it's angel foodwith chocolate on top.I knew it.Sorry I'm late.I didn't realize you had to turnthe oven on to bake stuff.So, Jenny, I hear you're religious.Know what my favorite bookof the Bible is?Revelations.Mine, too.Bart, we should take Milhouseon our trip to juice country.Are you nuts?Milhouse will spill everything.By which I mean juice, not secrets.Yeah, you guys don't want me there.But I'm surewe'll see each other soon.Bart, you look tense.Have a cookie.If you don't stop smiling,you're gonna get a kiss.That's it!We're getting you off the meds.We should be safe from Milhouse, here.Being at sea level gives him nosebleeds.Milhouse is funny.The way he's always shaking meby the shouldersand saying:"I don't know the real you."Funny.I'm tired of talking about Milhouse.Hello, Bart.Surprised to see me at sea level?You can't bleed out your nosewhen your heart's broken.Milhouse, could you stop being creepyfor just a minute?Jenny, do you seehow the dolphin in that tankseems to shy away from Bart?Why might that be?I can't take the pressure anymore.I have to come clean.I'm only pretending to be good.Before I met you, I wasEl Barto, Skinner's Bane,the Sultan of Spitwads,the Dean of D-minus, the Ay Carumba Kid!But now, I'm goodbecause you turned me good.Isn't that all that matters?Are you sayingour entire relationshipis based on lies?Not our entire relationship.Just the stuff I said.I can't believe she dumped me.Son, girls come and go.But you'll always have your family!I know, I know!- Hit me again, 'Pu.- Whatever you are looking for,it is not at the bottomof a 512-ounce cupof Shrek Berry Blast.What is at the bottomis the "Stump Shrek Trivia Quiz"which, if answered correctly,entitles you to ten percentof any Shrek DVD...except the first two.Bart, in my concurrent adventure,I learned a really important lesson:you can't wallow in despair.Face things as they really are.You're right.I've gotta straighten this out.How much for these roses?Ten dollars.What happened to my roses?You said you'd watch 'em.No such conversation took place.What am I gonna puton my Grandma's grave?How about this standeefrom last year's Super Bowl?Sold.Grandma, a lot has happened:I went to a condo presentation,I put down my deposit,but then they lostfunding mid-project.That crane just sits there every day.Rusting.I'm so sorry I've tried to denywho I really was.
