Case dismissed.Your Honor...uh, do I still get paid?I hope there areno hard feelings.Get bent.I deserve that.I know we let you down,but me and the boys...we still thinkyou've got a big future...in racketeeringand extortion.I used to thinkyour gang was cool...but now I learned...that crime doesn't pay.Yeah, you're right.Blood on the Blackboard::The Bart Simpson Story...starring Richard Chamberlainas Principal Skinner...Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony...Jane Seymouras the woman he loved...and Neil Patrick Harrisas Bart Simpson.Let's get out of here.Shut up.Where do you want it, Skinner?Not smart.- Cool!- When do we get the check for this?They changed itjust enough...so they don't haveto pay us.You know whothe real crooks are--those sleazyHollywood producers.Shh!
