                <h2> The Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                <p>We want to find how The Simpsons TV show has changed over the years in the amount of accounts of certain characters, phrases, and overall changes. We will do this by looking not at the entire collection but seasons 1,10,20, and 30 as they are 10 years apart each and 
                    could show monumental changes over the years. Specifically, our mission is to seek out how often the different family members, as well as musical occurences, appear throughout the history of the series. </p>
