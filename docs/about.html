            <h2 style="color: #2f64d6;">Why The Simpsons Project?</h2>
            <p>The Simpsons has been my favorite show since I was a kid. Over the years the world has changed drastically which made me curious of how or if television shows have changed with it. The Simpsons, a show that many have known and loved for over 30 years was the perfect subject as it had run throughout such a lengthy timeline. 
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: #9c5b01;">What I did...</h2>
            <p> For this project I worked with our website development along with my group members. Besides helping with the  website development I compiled out RNG Schema of which was problematic at first but due to simple fixes worked for all of our project files. I also made some SVG graphs for our project which are in the analysis section of the project website. In the end I believe that we have come up with a very good website and project overall.

            <h2 style="color: #2f64d6;">Why The Simpsons Project?</h2>
            <p>Why I was compelled by the idea of working on a Simpsons project was the sheer amount of cultural influence the show has in media and pop culture in general. Watching the Simpsons with my dad as I grew up embedded the show in my mind for years to come. It's a phenomenon that has been on the air for over 30 years, making it a rich and well-known subject with a vast amount of topics to draw from. 
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: #9c5b01;">What I did...</h2>
            <p>As I reflect on the project, I found that it provided me with an opportunity to further develop my skills within digital creation. During my time with developing The Simpsons project, I was involved in developing text descriptions, explanations, and fixing spelling errors throughout the website along with the collaboration and inputs from each of my fellow group members. Another aspect of the project I was involved in was working with the XML development for the web page. Additionally, I worked on a few of the SVGs and graphs utilized within the analysis section of our website. Overall, I am very pleased with the results of our work.

            <h2 style="color: #2f64d6;">Why The Simpsons Project?</h2>
            <p>I’ve always loved the Simpsons. I grew up on it. I remember my family would record them and then while we ate breakfast, we would sit there and watch them. It would line up perfectly. Right as the episode was in the end credits, it was time for school. It was a simple routine but I loved it. I always found the show comforting so this mattered to me.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: #9c5b01;">What I did...</h2>
            <p>I worked mostly with the website and developing the python though neither are my strong suit, but I really did learn a lot through this. I learned the most about file management. Team building and overall just managing code. Taking the small problems that arose and dealing with them in order. It was nice to see all the work we put in to eventually lead to something we can show off to the world even if it’s relatively small in the grand scheme of the World Wide Web.
