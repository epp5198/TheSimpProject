Okay. Over a lifetime of credit card debt, and paying for credit card debt with worse credit card debt, this family has two million hotel rewards loyalty... points, which we can only use at the nearest Second Best Western Motel.

Your daughter's fine, but I recommend a five-day stay.    

Of course, of course. We'll take out a third mortgage.    

Sir, you're in Canada now, where your health care is free. 

Free health care.
Why can't America do that?    

She's delirious, Doc.    

America can't pay for health care and give corporations the tax breaks they so desperately need.    

I'm not delirious.    

In fact, I've never felt more protected.    

Not like back home.    

Ooh, hang on. Did you just say you don't feel safe in your home country?    

Why should she feel safe?    

In America, the great El Barto roams the streets.    

So, let me get this straight: you're afraid of America.    

Is that right, young lady?    

- Well, there's voter suppression...

You can't separate us from our child.

Well, then you leave us no choice.

Great. Come on. Bring it in, bring it in.

Mom, I'm okay.

Homer, you take Bart back to Springfield.    

I am going for my daughter.    

Local smarty-pants Lisa Simpson has been abducted by America's Ned Flanders to the north, Canada.    

Here in Springfield, reactions to Lisa's loss have been loud and uninformed.    

Lisa was the moral center of this town.    

Now it's Barney, who knows nothing.    

Except it is the purpose of government to see that not only the legitimate interests of the few are protected, but that the rights of the many are conserved.

Is there any way I can send a note? Or maybe I could...

Weak. He called me weak.    

Absolutely.    

Let me ask you.

But there's one thing I need you to do.    

Take one last look at the country you left behind and focus on anything good about it.    

You're right.
America's like a great boyfriend that maybe got a little fat and lost a little hair.    

What does that have to do with anything? Just go.
