Whatever.   

Homer, is it too late to change babysitters?   

Yes.   

So I'll have to stay home.   

I don't think we have to... Homer.   

Yes, Marge?!   

We both have to go to Drug Awareness Night!

This is pointless.   

We learned all the new dangerous drugs last year: sprack, zup, borzo, and crystal bam.   

I hear they're mixing bam with zup.   

Interesting.   

Bam and zup. [CHUCKLES]

But do you know how much love is lost between these teams?   

None!

No, just cake.

"Inguinal."

Possibly. But don't be alarmed.

Honey, I signed us up for physical therapy this afternoon.    

They sound terrific.    

Even booking the appointment, they told me, "Great job."    

Absolutely.    

I want to get better.    

I really do.    

I know you do.    

We'll start tomorrow.    

Mwah.

Guys like us don't look good in shorts.    

Oh, why is it never hair growth?    

It's me, your hernia.    

Homer, your doctor told you to listen to your body.    

And I am telling you, just take it easy.    

Are you sure?    

I just promised Marge.    

Take it from your hernia.    

[GIGGLES]    

[MARGE GRUNTING] 

[NEW ZEALAND ACCENT]: Oh, you've got this, Marge!    

Now, focus on your co-ah.    

I guess I've been neglecting my key-aah.    

Is it this?    

No. All I can say is, if you have a muscle and you know what it does, then that is not the co-ah.    

Oh, the core. 

Right, that's what I said... co-ah.    

Now, what sports are we gettin' you ready for, Marge?    

Rollerblading? Uh, Muay Thai?    

No, nothing like that.    

I only have to be in good enough shape to take care of an immobile    -pound man.    

Ah, so Homer isn't coming, eh?    

You know, I could go to him at work.    

Oh, he's got enough stress at work.    

All right, well, we'll get you into something.    

Uh, mountain biking? Free bouldering?    

I got it. Marge, we are going to get you kitesurfing!    

Kitesurfing?    

I could do that with Homie.    

[ALARM BLARES]    

You know what?    

I'm not letting Homer drag me down this time.    

Yes, I want to learn kitesurfing.

Kitesurfing's a simple sport.    

All you need is the wind and the waves.    

And a spreader-bar, bindings, impact vest, chicken loop, donkey stick, squirrel clip, and, of course, parking pass.    

Yeah, ruining people's day at the beach.    

We are worse than sand in a hot dog, eh, Lou?    

You know there's a double m*rder downtown?    

Well, now it's a triple, 'cause you just k*ll my day.    

Keep the kite swooping, Marge.    

Follow the timing of my pecs.    

Left, right, left, right, left, left, right...    

Ah. Don't look me in the eyes, Marge.    

My pecs are down here.    

There you are.

So, Mom is kitesurfing while Dad is eating three desserts.    

Oh, your grandma and I had our differences, but we stopped arguing when she disappeared for three decades.    

Oh.    

Oh, it's so nice to get an evening out just with you.    

Can I get you a baby chair?    

No? You're good?    

Homer's-a talking to nobody.    

The Cat Lady is eating with cats.    

Ralph is in-a the lobster t*nk?    

I'm expensive.    

Homer, you're doing great.    

Look at those guys... eating half portions, trying to stay fit.    

They're just setting themselves up to meet my buddies    

Torn ACL and Pinched Nerve.    

Now, you, you're smart.    

The most strenuous thing you're gonna do is fart "The Star Spangled Banner."    

Mm, that's got a difficult range.    

Is there an easier anthem?    

Hey, the riskiest thing we're gonna do is have lasagna.    

We just had lasagna.    

Have it again!    

Nobody's gonna stop you.    

I love you.    

Who are you?    

Cirrhosis. What's it to ya?    

Homer, I'm going to the beach.    

I packed lunch for two if you want to come.    

Oh, the beach.    

Sure. Let's get sunstroke, a hyperextended tendon, and wrap it up by getting decapitated by a Frisbee.    

Hard pass.    

Sorry, Marge. Hard pass.    

[SIGHS] It's been so long since you made a move on me.    

Or any move.    

Um, how about if I drone you a kiss?

Hurry up, Marge.    

We're gonna catch big air all morning, sleep all afternoon, then boil a sheep for breakfast.    

I'm still on New Zealand time.    

Been here    years but can't shake it.    

Please, Homer, you're my husband.    

Get up and live. 

Sorry, Marge. I got to go with my gut.

If you don't come after me, there's a big problem.    

The drone doesn't count.    

Hey. Can you watch the kids this afternoon?    

Sorry, Marge.    

Hernia.    

We make quite a team.    

Who are you talking to?    

Hey, I do not have voices in my head.

Just call my sisters to watch the kids.

Our parents are drifting apart.    

And as much as I don't enjoy doing this, I need the advice of the only couple we know that seems to like each other.    

I'm stuck with you. 

Relationships are simple, really.    

Like, if Shauna's best friend Tiffany comes on to me,    

I make out with Shauna, but I pretend it's her friend.

Don't listen to them.    

You can see me?!    

It's always the babies.    

Hey. Where are the turtles?    

There are no turtles, Homer. It's a trick.    

These kids are trying to help you, 'cause they love you.    

So there never were turtles?    

No turtles!    

I'm starting to think there were no turtles.

She looks so beautiful.    

I've been such a fool.

I'll never let myself go like that!    

I'm-a comin', Marge!    

Ew! Gross!    

Homer, you're making me mad.    

And if there's one thing you don't want to aggravate, it's a hernia!    

I'm Marge's husband, Homer.    

Homer! Good-o!    

Would you like me to rehab you at work?    

I could come right to you. Same price.    

Maybe. But now I need your biggest, fastest kite.

Can you say that without an accent?

Chief, I've got to make dinner for my kids. Could you please    

- tell me what this is about?
- Like most physical therapists in America, this man is actually a Russian spy.    

Nigel is a spy?    

Dimitri Nigelovonovitch.    

Did you ever wonder why he was so interested in seeing your husband at work?    

I thought it was close to his house.    

Didn't you ever ask yourself how a beach bum like him could afford a top-of-the-line  Saturn SUV with a full spare tire?    

I guess I didn't want to know.    

Just thank God, thank God your husband is entrapping him now.    

Homer, I just need a few pictures of...  the co-ah.    

- The what?
- Goo-ah.    

- The car?
