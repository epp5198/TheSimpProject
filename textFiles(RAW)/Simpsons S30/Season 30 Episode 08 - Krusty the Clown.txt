Hubert, great work on the cafeteria gravy story.  

Answered a lot of questions but raised a lot more.  

[DOOR OPENS]  

I come bearing the thing you journalists hate most: news.  

The Daily Fourth Gradian is hemorrhaging money.  

Last month the paper lost...  

$  .  

[ALL GASPING]   

But you can't put a price on the truth.   

I finally got a source to go on the record about dodgeball concussions.   

b*mb, b*mb.   

[CRYING]: b*mb.   

I'm sorry, but I have no choice but to bring in a new editor.   

The fifth grader who somehow turned the school poetry magazine into a cash-blasting f*re hose: Billy.   

Preschool is over, news skanks.   

Today is gonna be like Carrie Underwood hosting the Country Music Awards... we're in for a lot of changes.   

You... I can tell you're a real talent.   

Get out. You're fired.   

See? No one's safe.   

Fidget spinner.   

What are you doing?   

Hubert's a good journalist.   

Good journalism ain't paying the pizza man, toots.   

We are going online only: pop-culture quizzes, sponsored lists, headlines that grab you by the book bag: "You Won't Believe What Milhouse Looks Like Now."   

You bet your book bag I won't.   

But you can't just turn the school paper into online clickbait.   

We have a responsibility to...   

Oh, my God, it's still talking.   

I hate you so much I'm giving you the most important job at this swipe rag.   

- You're a what?
- I'm a recapper.   

Huh? What?   

A TV recapper.   

I watch every episode of a show, then write a summary, followed by snarky comments and a letter grade.   

Well, sometimes I do worry I have the wrong opinions about what I've just seen.

[LISA GROANS]   

Ugh. This isn't me.   

What kind of person can just spew out an endless stream of knee-jerk reactions?   

They should hand out candy at Thanksgiving and stuffing at Halloween.   

Say, Dad, you sure have a lot of strong opinions.   

Why don't you watch this show and tell me what you think?

Mm-hmm.   

Hmm.   

The mouse and the cat hate each other.   

That feels real to me.   

It was quite a ride, and I was on board until the shawarma screamed. Huh.   

Very disappointing.   

An instant classic.   

Dad, you were born to describe TV at a fourth-grade level.   

[LAUGHING]: Ooh, well.   

Would you recap The Krusty Show for my school paper?   

All you have to do is watch TV and say things about it.   

Just say things about TV.

Krusty, a recapper is now reviewing your show.   

Let me see that.

"Pie clearly hits face of stunt double"?   

"Overuse of comedic rule of three"?!

You're a clown.    

I won't stand here and be insulted!

Kid, I'm a TV clown not like these trapeze-sucking tent-fluffers.    

Circus clowns don't talk, while I perform to camera with finely honed subtlety.    

Hey-hey! [LAUGHS]    

[SHUSHES] Easy on the "hey-heys."    

The cops are looking everywhere for you.    

I can't go to jail.    

I just quit smoking. What do I do?    

Huh?    

So, what do you call yourself?    

- Soggy. Soggy the Clown.
- Thought we already had a Soggy.    

Nah, nah, you're thinking of Moisty.    

You're hired.    

So, Soggy, uh, what's your act?    

Well, I can introduce cartoons, pretend to enjoy children's breakfast cereal.    

Oh, and I completely blow my stack when someone takes my parking space.    

You sound like a... TV clown.    

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.    

I hate TV clowns from how you just said that.    

[SCOFFS] TV clowns. Riding four to a car like royalty, eating their stew from a bowl instead of cupped hands.    

And you know who's the worst is that white-faced Judas: Krusty.    

Wait. Circus clowns hate Krusty?    

Don't you?    

In my way I've hated him all my life.    

Yeah, you get it, Soggy.
You're a good kid.    

Anyway, this is where you eat, this is where you sleep, and this is where you sweep up the elephant crap.    

So, all three in this cage.

Why are you making so many shows?

We just care if they subscribe
