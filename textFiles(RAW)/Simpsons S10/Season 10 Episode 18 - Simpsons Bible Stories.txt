And as we pass the collection plate...

please give as though the person next to you were watching.

[ Groans, Sighs ] Oh, man.

This is the hottest Easter ever.

Even that praying mantis is losing it.

[ Groaning ]

Thank you, Helen.

And thank you all for your kind contrib- [ Gasps ]

A chocolate bunny?

Who put this wicked idol in the collection plate?

[ Congregation Gasps ]

Relax. I found it in the Dumpster.

Perhaps we need a hefty dose of the good book.

[ Marge Groans ]

"In the beginning"-

Excuse me, Reverend. It's hard to hear you with those fans going.

Well, let's get those off then.

[ Homer Groans ]

"In the beginning...

God created the heavens and the Earth."

Which brings us back to our-

[ Snores ]

Ooh. Ooh!

[ Animals Purring, Calling ]

What a beautiful garden.

It's almost like paradise.

[ Homer ] Heads up.!

Whee! [ Grunts ]

[ Gasps ]

Well, hello.

Aren't you hurt?

Of course not. There's no pain in the Garden of Eden.

Hey, you must be Eve.

Mmm, I guess.

Looks like God made you out of my sexiest rib. [ Growls ]

Speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here?

Is there!

Good morning, Adam. Any bacon for you then?

Don't mind if I do.

[ Ned ] Hi-diddly-ho, paradise dwellers!

[ Gasps ]

Good morning, Lord. I just have to compliment you... on this beautifully crafted mate.

Oh, Adam, you're too kind.

No, you're too kind and wise and righteous.

I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend.

[ Chuckles ] Oh, please! You're gonna give me a swelled head.

I just stopped by to see if you needed anything.

Well, some general-interest magazines would be nice.

You got it, Eve.

There you go.

Oh, thanks.

Well, I better skedaddle. Oh, there's one more weensy little thing.

See that tree over there? I hate to be a bossy Betty...

See that tree over there? I hate to be a bossy Betty...

but I have to forbid you to eat its fruit.

No problem, Lord. And it would be even easier... to avoid that temptation if I had a few extra wives.

[ Groans ]

I'm just sayin'.

[ Chittering ]

Oh, how cute.

Let's call this little guy a groundhog.

Sorry, I already gave him a name: land monster.

Really?

Well, what do you call that thing on the branch?

[ Hisses ]

Branch monster.

[ Snake ] Please, please, call me Snake.

Yo, have you dudes sampled this fruit?

It's, like, God's private stash.

But he said it was forbidden.

Quite so, mum. I recall one of the dinosaurs had a bite.

And, well, that was the last of- Egad!

Please stop eating that. God's going to be furious.

You're pretty uptight for a naked chick.

You know what would loosen you up? A little fruit.

Mmm, well, it is a sin to waste food.

And you keep saying we need to do things together.

Hmm.

Mmm! This could really spice up those pies I've been making.

[ Thunderclap ]

[ Ned ] What the dickens?

[ Gasps ]

Eve, did you taste of the forbidden fruit?

Ohh.

♪ [ Whistling ]

Yes, God.

Doggone it, Eve.

I think you'd better hightail it out of this garden!

Adam, say something!

Uh, um- Uh, I think we should see other people.

You heard me. Vamoose!

[ Gasps ]

[ Groans ]

[ Whines ]

Oh! Usually a mink massage makes me feel better.

But something's missing now.

I didn't say stop.

Lovely day in paradise, isn't it?

Yeah. Just like yesterday.

Today I'm featuring mouthwatering pork ribs. Tuck in then.

[ Sloshing, Snapping ]

Oh. I gave a rib to Eve, and now she's gone forever.

One whole rib and still standing. Well, aren't you the plucky one, sir?

Come on!

Oh, poor Eve.

What are you doing out there in that horrible place?

I'm toiling. What does it look like?

Oh, this is my fault. I should have stood up for you during that whole "Applegate" thing.

Well, it's a little late for apologies now.

Don't say that. Maybe I can sneak you back in.

I mean, God can't be everywhere at once, right?

♪ [ Whistling, Scatting ]

Somebody order a hole?

Ooh, that's a tight squeeze.

[ Gasping ]

Oh, thank you.

Are you okay?

I'll be fine.

Just give me a second to- [ Groans ]

[ Gasps ]

[ Homer ] Come on, Eve.! Hurry.!

[ Grunting ]

Oh, my dear sweet Eve.

I love you even more than the butterscotch pond or the p*rn bush.

So! This is how you repay me, Adam!

[ Gasps ]

[ Both Groan ]

And after I created my fingers to the bone for you. I-

[ Gasps, Screams ] My unicorn!

Oh, what have they done to you, Gary?

Oh, there, there. I'm sure he's gone to a better place, Lord.

Oh, shut up! You are so banished.

Hey, now let's not do anything rash. God is love, right?

[ Screams ]

God, you have every right to flick me out too.

But before you- [ Screams ]

Oh, my back!

So this must be that pain thing.

[ Groans ] Oh, yeah.

Definitely pain.

[ Animal Howling in Distance ]

This sucks.

Things were so much better back in the garden.

I'm sure God will let us return soon.

I mean, how long can he hold a grudge?

[ Reverend Lovejoy ] "Forever-

Hmm?

"and ever... and ever, a"-

And that concludes Genesis... the first of the 66 books of the Bible.

Man, captivity blows.

Talk to the whip. [ Grunts ]

[ Whinnying ]

On your knees, ya mugs! It's the pharaoh!

Ah, excellent progress, Slave Driver Willie.

Kudos on your whipping.

Oh, he noticed!

Ay! Suffering sarcophagus! My tomb!

Who did this?

[ Chuckles ]

Come on, confess. Don't make me slay all the firstborn males again.

Bart did it. I saw him do it.

Take him away, boys.

No! The bush set me up!

As for the rest of you, it's time for a little discipline.

Slave Driver, put away the encouragement whip and break out the cruel whip.

[ All Gasp, Murmur]

[ Grunts ]

[ All Yelp ]

Heh! That's the new omni-lash, boys.

Just look at that snapback.

Yeah, it's sweet.

We can't keep living like this. Moses, ask Pharaoh to let your people go.

Oh, now they're my people.

Scrub harder, slave! I want to be able to eat off that thing!

And make it snappy. It's almost lunchtime.

I think Moses here has something to ask you. Go!

Uh, let my people go.

Let your people go?

I've never heard such insolence! You call yourselves slaves?

[ Both Groaning ]

Well, the ball's in his court now.

All right, read me back what I have so far, Mrs. Krabapatra.

"Bird, bird, giant eye, pyramid, bird."

Mm-hmm. Very good.

Uh, giant eye, d*ad fish, cat head, cat head, cat head... guy doing this-

[ Croaking ]

What? What the-

Keep that plague coming, Moses.

Frogs away!

[ Laughing ]

We spent all our money, but it was worth it. Now he's gotta let us go!

Mmm. Mmm!

These are the juiciest frogs I've ever eaten.

Mmm! Ra has rewarded my cruelty to the slaves.

It's a plague, you moron! And we got lots more planned.

And there's nothing you can do about it!

[ Both Scream ]

So long, kids.

Give my regards to the British Museum.

[ Chuckles ]

[ Both Screaming ]

[ Both Grunt ]

Do you think we could ever be more than just friends?

Not now, Moses! We gotta find a way outta here.

I know we built a secret passage in here somewhere.

I found it! We're outta here!

Uh-oh.

[ Together] Help!

Eh, slave labor. You get what you pay for.

Whee!

Whoo!

Hey, Chief. He splashed me!

Look, nobody likes a crybaby, okay? You just splash him back.

[ Cheering ]

Well, Lisa, we're out of Egypt.

So, what's next for the lsraelites? Land of milk and honey?

Hmm. Well, actually it looks like we're in for 40 years of wandering the desert.

Forty years?

But after that, it's clear sailing for the Jews, right?

Uhh- [ Quavering ] More or less. Hey, is that manna?

[ Cheering ]

Now we come to King Solomon, whose wisdom was like a drill... boring into the rock of injustice.

Boring.

Boring.

Boring.

King Solomon, these men need you to settle a dispute.

They each claim ownership of this pie.

Hmm.

The pie shall be cut in two.

What else you got?

Well, wait a minute. I got something on the Canaanites.

Oh. They are so stupid-

[ Groaning ]

[ Crowd Gasps ]

Methuselah, my oldest friend, who did this to you?

Oh, it was Goliath.

But Goliath is d*ad. I smote him myself.

I "smoted" him good.

No, it was his son, Goliath II. [ Grunts ]

No-o-o!

Goliath II is gonna pay.

And this time it's biblical.

I'll just give Goliath II the old rock to the head... applause, applause, you gotta believe in yourself, stay in school, and we're outta here.

I don't know, Davey.

Quiet, you.

Oh, you've gotten pretty fat, Davey.

You died the way you lived- inside a whale.

I trampled four giant-slayers today.

I think I earned this.

Don't you know smoking stunts your growth?

Well, well, well, if it isn't the little prince.

I'm not afraid of you, Goliath. Before, I was arrogant.

But now my heart is humbled. And my spirit is-

What do you know? A king fit for a meal.

Hope I don't give you... heartburn! [ Grunts ]
